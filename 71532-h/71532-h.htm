<p>In the early days of the colony of Massachusetts
Bay, careful lists were sent
back to old England by the magistrates, telling
what “to provide to send to New England”
in order to ensure the successful
planting and tender nourishing of the new
settlement. The earliest list includes such
homely items as “benes and pese,” tame
turkeys, copper kettles, all kinds of useful
apparel and wholesome food; but the list is
headed with a most significant, a typically
Puritan item, <i>Ministers</i>. The list sent to
the Emigration Society by the Virginian
colonists might equally well have been
headed, to show their most crying need,
with the word <i>Wives</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>The settlement of Virginia bore an entirely
different aspect from that of New England.
It was a community of men who planted
Jamestown. There were few women among
the early Virginians. In 1608 one Mistress
Forrest came over with a maid, Anne Burraws,
who speedily married John Laydon, the
first marriage of English folk in the new
world. But wives were few, save squaw-wives,
therefore the colony did not thrive. Sir
Edwin Sandys, at a meeting of the Emigration
Society in London, in November, 1619,
said that “though the colonists are seated
there in their persons some four years, they
are not settled in their minds to make it
their place of rest and continuance.” They
all longed to gather gold and to return to
England as speedily as possible, to leave
that state of “solitary uncouthness,” as one
planter called it. Sandys and that delightful
gentleman, the friend and patron of
Shakespeare, the Earl of Southampton,
planned, as an anchor in the new land, to
send out a cargo of wives for these planters,
that the plantation might “grow in generations
and not be pieced out from without.”
In 1620 the Jonathan and the London Merchant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
brought ninety maids to Virginia on a
venture, and a most successful venture it
proved.</p>

<p>There are some scenes in colonial life
which stand out of the past with much clearness
of outline, which seem, though no
details survive, to present to us a vivid picture.
One is this landing of ninety possible
wives—ninety homesick, seasick but
timidly inquisitive English girls—on Jamestown
beach, where pressed forward, eagerly
and amorously waiting, about four hundred
lonely emigrant bachelors—bronzed, sturdy
men, in leather doublets and breeches and
cavalier hats, with glittering swords and
bandoleers and fowling-pieces, without doubt
in their finest holiday array, to choose and
secure one of these fair maids as a wife.
Oh, what a glorious and all-abounding courting,
a mating-time, was straightway begun
on the Virginian shore on that happy day in
May. A man needed a quick eye, a ready
tongue, a manly presence, if he were to
succeed against such odds in supply and
demand, and obtain a fair one, or indeed
any one, from this bridal array. But whosoever
he won was indeed a prize, for all were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
asserted to be “young, handsome, honestly
educated maids, of honest life and carriage”—what
more could any man desire? Gladly
did the husband pay to the Emigration
Company the one hundred and twenty
pounds of leaf tobacco, which formed, in one
sense, the purchase money for the wife.
This was then valued at about eighty dollars:
certainly a man in that matrimonial
market got his money’s worth; and the
complaining colonial chronicler who asserted
that ministers and milk were the only cheap
things in New England, might have added—and
wives the only cheap things in
Virginia.</p>

<p>It was said by old writers that some of
these maids were seized by fraud, were
trapanned in England, that unprincipled
spirits “took up rich yeomans’ daughters to
serve his Majesty as breeders in Virginia
unless they paid money for their release.”
This trapanning was one of the crying
abuses of the day, but in this case it seems
scarcely present. For the girls appear to
have been given a perfectly fair showing in
all this barter. They were allowed to marry
no irresponsible men, to go nowhere as servants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
and, indeed, were not pressed to marry
at all if against their wills. They were to
be “housed lodged and provided for of diet”
until they decided to accept a husband.
Naturally nearly all did marry, and from the
unions with these young, handsome and
godly-carriaged maids sprang many of our
respected Virginian families.</p>

<p>No coquetry was allowed in this mating.
A girl could not promise to marry two men,
under pain of fine or punishment; and at
least one presumptuous and grasping man
was whipped for promising marriage to two
girls at the same time—as he deserved to
be when wives were so scarce.</p>

<p>Other ship-loads of maids followed, and
with the establishment of these Virginian
families was dealt, as is everywhere else
that the family exists, a fatal blow at a community
of property and interests, but the
colony flourished, and the civilization of the
new world was begun. For the unit of
society may be the individual, but the molecule
of civilization is the family. When
men had wives and homes and children they
“sett down satysfied” and no longer sighed
for England. Others followed quickly and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
eagerly; in three years thirty-five hundred
emigrants had gone from England to Virginia,
a marked contrast to the previous
years of uncertainty and dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Virginia was not the only colony to import
wives for its colonists. In 1706 His Majesty
Louis XIV. sent a company of twenty young
girls to the Governor of Louisiana, Sieur de
Bienville, in order to consolidate his colony.
They were to be given good homes, and to
be well married, and it was thought they
would soon teach the Indian squaws many
useful domestic employments. These young
girls were of unspotted reputation, and upright
lives, but they did not love their new
homes; a dispatch of the Governor says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The men in the colony begin through habit to
use corn as an article of food, but the women,
who are mostly Parisians, have for this kind of
food a dogged aversion which has not been subdued.
Hence they inveigh bitterly against his
Grace the Bishop of Quebec who they say has
enticed them away from home under pretext of
sending them to enjoy the milk and honey of the
land of promise.</p>
</div>

<p>I don’t know how this venture succeeded,
but I cannot fancy anything more like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
personification of incompatibility, of inevitable
failure, than to place these young Parisian
women (who had certainly known of the
manner of living of the court of Louis XIV.)
in a wild frontier settlement, and to expect
them to teach Western squaws any domestic
or civilized employment, and then to
make them eat Indian corn, which they
loathed as do the Irish peasants. Indeed,
they were to be pitied. They rebelled and
threatened to run away—whither I cannot
guess, nor what they would eat save Indian
corn if they did run away—and they stirred
up such a dissatisfaction that the imbroglio
was known as the Petticoat Rebellion, and
the governor was much jeered at for his unsuccessful
wardship and his attempted matrimonial
agency.</p>

<p>In 1721 eighty young girls were landed
in Louisiana as wives, but these were not
godly-carriaged young maids; they had been
taken from Houses of Correction, especially
from Paris. In 1728 came another company
known as <i>filles à la cassette</i>, or casket girls,
for each was given by the French government
a casket of clothing to carry to the new
home; and in later years it became a matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
of much pride to Louisianians that their
descent was from the casket-girls, rather
than from the correction-girls.</p>

<p>Another wife-market for the poorer class
of wifeless colonists was afforded through
the white bond-servants who came in such
numbers to the colonies. They were of
three classes; convicts, free-willers or redemptioners,
and “kids” who had been
stolen and sent to the new world, and sold
often for a ten years’ term of service.</p>

<p>Maryland, under the Baltimores, was the
sole colony that not only admitted convicts,
but welcomed them. The labor of the
branded hand of the malefactor, the education
and accomplishments of the social outcast,
the acquirements and skill of the intemperate
or over-competed tradesman, all were
welcome to the Maryland tobacco-planters;
and the possibilities of rehabilitation of fortune,
health, reputation, or reëstablishment
of rectitude, made the custom not unwelcome
to the convict or to the redemptioner.
Were the undoubted servant no rogue, but
an honest tradesman, crimped in English
coast-towns and haled off to Chesapeake
tobacco fields, he did not travel or sojourn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
perforce, in low company. He might find
himself in as choice companionship, with
ladies and gentlemen of as high quality,
albeit of the same character, as graced those
other English harbors of ne’er-do-weels,
Newgate or the Fleet Prison. Convicts
came to other colonies, but not so openly
nor with so much welcome as to Maryland.</p>

<p>All the convicts who came to the colonies
were not rogues, though they might be condemned
persons. The first record in Talbot
County, Maryland, of the sale of a convict,
was in September, 1716, “in the third Yeare
of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord King
George.” And it was for rebellion and treason
against his Majesty that this convict,
Alexander MacQueen, was taken in Lancashire
and transported to America, and sold
to Mr. Daniel Sherwood for seven years of
service. With him were transported two
shiploads of fellow-culprits, Jacobites, on the
Friendship and Goodspeed. The London
Public Record Office (on American and West
India matters, No. 27) records this transportation
and says the men were “Scotts Rebells.”
Earlier still, many of the rebels of
Monmouth’s rebellion had been sold for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
transportation, and the ladies of the court
of James had eagerly snatched at the profits
of the sale. Even William Penn begged for
twenty of these rebels for the Philadelphia
market. Perhaps he was shrewd enough to
see in them good stock for successful citizens.
Were the convict a condemned criminal,
it did not necessarily follow that he or
she was thoroughly vicious. One English
husband is found petitioning on behalf of
his wife, sentenced to death for stealing but
three shillings and sixpence, that her sentence
be changed to transportation to Virginia.</p>

<p>The redemptioners were willing immigrants,
who contracted to serve for a period
of time to pay the cost of their passage,
which usually had been prepaid to the master
of the ship on which they came across-seas.
At first the state of these free-willers
was not unbearable. Alsop, who was a redemptioner,
has left on record that the work
required was not excessive:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Five dayes and a halfe in the summer is the
allotted time that they worke, and for two months,
when the Sun is predominate in the highest pitch
of his heat, they claim an antient and customary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
Priviledge to repose themselves three hours in
the day within the house. In Winter they do
little but hunt and build fires.</p>
</div>

<p class="p0">and he adds, “the four years I served there
were not to me so slavish as a two-year’s
servitude of a handicraft apprenticeship in
London.”</p>

<p>Many examples can be given where these
redemptioners rose to respected social positions.
In 1654, in the Virginia Assembly
were two members and one Burgess who had
been bond-servants. Many women-servants
married into the family of their employers.
Alsop said it was the rule for them to marry
well. The niece of Daniel Defoe ran away
to escape a marriage entanglement in England,
sold herself on board ship as a redemptioner
when but eighteen years old, was
bought by a Mr. Job of Cecil County, Maryland,
and soon married her employer’s son.
Defoe himself said that so many good maid-servants
were sold to America that there was
a lack for domestic service in England.</p>

<p>Through the stealing of children and
youths to sell in the plantations, it can
plainly be seen that many a wife of respectable
birth was furnished to the colonists.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
This trade, by which, as Lionel Gatford
wrote in 1657, young people were “cheatingly
duckoyed by Poestigeous Plagiaries,”
grew to a vast extent, and in it, emulating
the noble ladies of the court, women of
lower rank sought a degrading profit.</p>

<p>In 1655, in Middlesex, England, one Christian
Sacrett was called to answer the complaint
of Dorothy Perkins:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She accuseth her for a spirit, one that takes
upp men women and children, and sells them
a-shipp to be conveyed beyond the sea, having
inticed and inveigled one Edward Furnifall and
Anna his wife with her infant to the waterside,
and putt them aboard the ship called the Planter
to be conveied to Virginia.</p>
</div>

<p>Sarah Sharp was also asserted to be a
“common taker of children and setter to
Betray young men and maydens to be conveyed
to ships.”</p>

<p>The life of that famous rogue, Bamfylde-Moore
Carew, shows the method by which
servants were sold in the plantations. The
captain, with his cargo of trapanned Englishmen,
among whom was Carew, cast anchor
at Miles River in Talbot County, Maryland,
ordered a gun to be fired, and a hogshead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
of rum sent on board. On the day of the
sale the men prisoners were all shaved, the
women dressed in their best garments, their
neatest caps, and brought on deck. Each
prisoner, when put up for sale, told his
trade. Carew said he was a good rat-catcher,
beggar, and dog-trader, “upon which the
Captain hearing takes the planter aside, and
tells him he did but jest, being a man of
humour, and would make an excellent schoolmaster.”
Carew escaped before being sold,
was captured, whipped, and had a heavy
iron collar, “called in Maryland a pot-hook,”
riveted about his neck; but he again fled
to the Indians, and returned to England.
Kidnapped in Bristol a second time, he was
nearly sold on Kent Island to Mr. Dulaney,
but again escaped. He stole from a house
“jolly cake, powell, a sort of Indian corn
bread, and good omani, which is kidney beans
ground with Indian corn, sifted, put into a
pot to boil, and eaten with molasses.” Jolly
cake was doubtless johnny cake; omani,
hominy; but powell is a puzzle. He made
his way by begging to Boston, and shipped
to England, from whence he was again trapanned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>In the <i>Sot-Weed Factor</i> are found some
very coarse but graphic pictures of the women
emigrants of the day. When the factor
asks the name of “one who passed for chambermaid”
in one planter’s house in “Mary-Land,”
she answered with an affected blush
and simper:—</p>

<p>Another time, being disturbed in his sleep,
the factor finds that in an adjoining room,—</p>

</div>

<p>The other makes, in turn, still more bitter
accusations. It can plainly be seen that such
social and domestic relations might readily
produce similar scenes, and afford opportunity
for “crimination and recrimination.”</p>

<p>Still we must not give the <i>Sot-Weed
Factor</i> as sole or indeed as entirely unbiased
authority. The testimony to the housewifely
virtues of the Maryland women by
other writers is almost universal. In the
<i>London Magazine</i> of 1745 a traveler writes,
and his word is similar to that of many
others:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The women are very handsome in general
and most notable housewives; everything wears
the Marks of Cleanliness and Industry in their
Houses, and their behavior to their Husbands
and Families is very edifying. You cant help
observing, however, an Air of Reserve and somewhat
that looks at first to a Stranger like Unsociableness,
which is barely the effect of living at a
great Distance from frequent Society and their
Thorough Attention to the Duties of their Stations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
Their Amusements are quite Innocent
and within the Circle of a Plantation or two.
They exercise all the Virtues that can raise Ones
Opinion of too light a Sex.</p>

<p>The girls under such good Mothers generally
have twice the Sense and Discretion of the Boys.
Their Dress is neat and Clean and not much
bordering upon the Ridiculous Humour of the
Mother Country where the Daughters seem
Dress’d up for a Market.</p>
</div>

<p>Wives were just as eagerly desired in New
England as in Virginia, and a married estate
was just as essential to a man of dignity. As
a rule, emigration thereto was in families,
but when New England men came to the
New World, leaving their families behind
them until they had prepared a suitable
home for their reception, the husbands were
most impatient to send speedily for their
consorts. Letters such as this, of Mr. Eyre
from England to Mr. Gibb in Piscataquay,
in 1631, show the sentiment of the settlers
in the matter:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I hope by this both your wives are with you
according to your desire. I wish all your wives
were with you, and that so many of you as desire
wives had such as they desire. Your wife, Roger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
Knight’s wife, and one wife more we have already
sent you and more you shall have as you wish
for them.</p>
</div>

<p>This sentence, though apparently polygamous
in sentiment, does not indicate an intent
to establish a Mormon settlement in
New Hampshire, but is simply somewhat
shaky in grammatical construction, and erratic
in rhetorical expression.</p>

<p>Occasionally, though rarely, there was
found a wife who did not long for a New
England home. Governor Winthrop wrote
to England on July 4, 1632:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have much difficultye to keepe John Gallope
heere by reason his wife will not come. I
marvayle at her womans weaknesse, that she will
live myserably with her children there when she
might live comfortably with her husband here.
I pray perswade and further her coming by all
means. If she will come let her have the remainder
of his wages, if not let it be bestowed to
bring over his children for soe he desires.</p>
</div>

<p>Even the ministers’ wives did not all sigh
for the New World. The removal of Rev.
Mr. Wilson to New England “was rendered
difficult by the indisposition of his dearest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
consort thereto.” He very shrewdly interpreted
a dream to her in favor of emigration,
with but scant and fleeting influence upon
her, and he sent over to her from America
encouraging accounts of the new home, and
he finally returned to England for her, and
after much fasting and prayer she consented
to “accompany him over an ocean to a
wilderness.”</p>

<p>Margaret Winthrop, that undaunted yet
gentle woman, wrote of her at this date (and
it gives us a glimpse of a latent element of
Madam Winthrop’s character), “Mr. Wilson
cannot yet persuade his wife to go, for all he
hath taken this pains to come and fetch her.
I marvel what mettle she is made of. Sure
she will yield at last.” She did yield, and
she did not go uncomforted. Cotton Mather
wrote:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mrs. Wilson being thus perswaded over into
the difficulties of an American desart, her kinsman
Old Mr. Dod, for her consolation under
those difficulties did send her a present with an
advice which had in it something of curiosity.
He sent her a <i>brass</i> counter, a <i>silver</i> crown, and
a <i>gold</i> jacobus, all severally wrapped up; with
this instruction unto the gentleman who carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
it; that he should first of all deliver only the
counter, and if she received it with any shew of
discontent, he should then take no notice of her;
but if she gratefully resented that small thing for
the sake of the hand it came from, he should
then go on to deliver the silver and so the gold,
but withal assure her that such would be the dispensations
to her and the good people of New
England. If they would be content and thankful
with such little things as God at first bestowed
upon them, they should, in time, have silver and
gold enough. Mrs. Wilson accordingly by her
cheerful entertainment of the least remembrance
from good old Mr. Dod, gave the gentleman
occasion to go through with his whole present
and the annexed advice.</p>
</div>

<p>We could not feel surprised if poor homesick,
heartsick, terrified Mrs. Wilson had
“gratefully resented” Mr. Dod’s apparently
mean gift to her on the eve of exile in our
modern sense of resentment; but the meaning
of resent in those days was to perceive
with a lively sense of pleasure. I do not
know whether this old Mr. Dod was the poet
whose book entitled <i>A Posie from Old Mr.
Dod’s Garden</i> was one of the first rare books
of poetry printed in New England in colonial
days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>We truly cannot from our point of view
“marvayle” that these consorts did not long
to come to the strange, sad, foreign shore,
but wonder that they were any of them ever
willing to come; for to the loneliness of an
unknown world was added the dread horror
of encounter with a new and almost mysterious
race, the blood-thirsty Indians, and if
the poor dames turned from the woods to
the shore, they were menaced by “murthering
pyrates.”</p>

<p>Gurdon Saltonstall, in a letter to John
Winthrop of Connecticut, as late as 1690,
tells in a few spirited and racy sentences of
the life the women lead in an unprotected
coast town. It was sad and terrifying in
reality, but there is a certain quaintness of
expression and metaphor in the narrative,
and a sly and demure thrusting at Mr. James,
that give it an element of humor. It was
written of the approach of a foe “whose
entrance was as formidable and swaggering
as their exit was sneaking and shamefull.”
Saltonstall says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My Wife &amp; family was posted at your Honʳˢ
a considerable while, it being thought to be ye
most convenient place for ye feminine Rendezvous.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Mr James who Commands in Chiefe
among them, upon ye coast alarum given, faceth
to ye Mill, gathers like a Snow ball as he goes,
makes a Generall Muster at yor Honʳˢ, and so
posts away with ye greatest speed, to take advantage
of ye neighboring rocky hills, craggy, inaccessible
mountains; so that Wᵗᵉᵛᵉʳ els is lost
Mr James and yᵉ Women are safe.</p>
</div>

<p>All women did not run at the approach
of the foe. A marked trait of the settlers’
wives was their courage; and, indeed, opportunities
were plentiful for them to show their
daring, their fortitude, and their ready ingenuity.
Hannah Bradley, of Haverhill,
Mass., killed one Indian by throwing boiling
soap upon him. This same domestic weapon
was also used by some Swedish women near
Philadelphia to telling, indeed to killing
advantage. A young girl in the Minot
House in Dorchester, Mass., shovelled live
coals on an Indian invader, and drove him
off. A girl, almost a child, in Maine, shut a
door, barred, and held it while thirteen women
and children escaped to a neighboring block-house
before the door and its brave defender
were chopped down. Anthony Bracket and
his wife, captured by savages, escaped through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
the wife’s skill with the needle. She literally
sewed together a broken birch-bark canoe
which they found, and in which they got
safely away. Most famous and fierce of all
women fighters was Hannah Dustin, who, in
1697, with another woman and a boy, killed
ten Indians at midnight, and started for
home; but, calling to mind a thought that
no one at home, without corroborative evidence,
would believe this extraordinary tale,
they returned, scalped their victims, and
brought home the bloody trophies safely to
Haverhill.</p>

<p>Some Englishwomen were forced to marry
their captors, forced by torture or dire distress.
Some, when captured in childhood,
learned to love their savage husbands.
Eunice Williams, daughter of the Deerfield
minister, a Puritan who hated the Indians
and the church of Rome worse than he hated
Satan, came home to her Puritan kinsfolk
wearing two abhorred symbols, a blanket
and crucifix, and after a short visit, not liking
a civilized life, returned to her Indian
brave, her wigwam, and her priest.</p>

<p>I have always been glad that it was my
far-away grandfather, John Hoar, who left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
his Concord home, and risked his life as
ambassador to the Indians to rescue one of
these poor “captivated” English wives, Mrs.
Mary Rowlandson, after her many and heart-rending
“savage removes.” I am proud of
his “very forward spirit” which made him
dare attempt this bold rescue, as I am proud
of his humanity and his intelligent desire to
treat the red men as human beings, furnishing
about sixty of them with a home and
decent civilizing employment. I picture him
“stoutly not afraid,” as he entered the camp,
and met the poor captive, and treated successfully
with her savage and avaricious
master, and then I see him tenderly leading
her, ragged, half-starved, and exhausted,
through the lonely forests home—home to
the “doleful solemn sight” of despoiled
Lancaster. And I am proud, too, of the
noble “Boston gentlewomen” who raised
twenty pounds as a ransom for Mary Rowlandson,
“the price of her redemption,” and
tenderly welcomed her to their homes and
hearts, so warmly that she could write of
them as “pitiful, tender-hearted, and compassionate
Christians,” whose love was so
bountiful that she could not declare it. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
any one to-day marvels that English wives
did not “much desire the new and doleful
land,” let them read this graphic and thrilling
story of the <i>Captivity, Removes, and Restauration
of Mary Rowlandson</i>, and he will
marvel that the ships were not crowded
with disheartened settlers returning to their
“faire English homes.”</p>

<p>A very exciting and singular experience
befell four dignified Virginian wives in Bacon’s
Rebellion, not through the Indians
but at the hands of their erstwhile friends.
It is evident that the women of that colony
were universally and deeply stirred by the
romance of this insurrection and war. We
hear of their dramatic protests against the
tyranny of the government. Sarah Drummond
vowed she feared the power of England
no more than a broken straw, and
contemptuously broke a stick of wood to
illustrate her words. Major Chriesman’s
wife, “the honor of her sex,” when her husband
was about to be put to death as a
rebel, begged Governor Berkeley to kill her
instead, as he had joined Bacon wholly at her
solicitation. One Ann Cotton was moved
by the war to drop into literary composition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
an extraordinary ebullition for a woman in
her day, and to write an account of the
Rebellion, as she deemed “too wordishly,”
but which does not read now very wordishly
to us. But for these four dames, the wives
of men prominent in the army under Governor
Berkeley—prime men, Ann Cotton calls
them—was decreed a more stirring participation
in the excitements of war. The brilliant
and erratic young rebel, Bacon, pressed
them into active service. He sent out
companies of horsemen and tore the gentlewomen
from their homes, though they remonstrated
with much simplicity that they
were “indisposed” to leave; and he brought
them to the scene of battle, and heartlessly
placed them—with still further and more
acute indisposition—on the “fore-front”
of the breastworks as a shield against the
attacks of the four distracted husbands with
their soldiers. We read that “the poor Gentlewomen
were mightily astonished at this
project; neather were their husbands void of
amazements at this subtill invention.” The
four dames were “exhibited to the view of
their husbands and ffriends in the towne
upon the top of the smalle worke he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
cast up in the night where he caused them
to tarey till he had finished his defence
against the enemy’s shott.” There stood
these four innocent and harmless wives,—“guardian
angells—the white gardes of the
Divell,” shivering through the chill September
night till the glimmering dawn saw completed
the rampart of earth and logs, or the
leaguer, as it was called by the writers with
that exactness and absolute fitness of expression
which, in these old chronicles, gives
such delight to the lover of good old English.
One dame was also sent to her husband’s
camp as a “white-aproned hostage”
to parley with the Governor. And this hiding
of soldiers behind women was done by
the order of one who was called the most
accomplished gentleman in Virginia, but
whom we might dub otherwise if we wished,
to quote the contemporary account, to “oppose
him further with pertinances and violent
perstringes.”</p>

<p>I wish I could truthfully say that one
most odious and degrading eighteenth century
English custom was wholly unknown
in America—the custom of wife-trading, the
selling by a husband of his wife to another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
man. I found, for a long time, no traces or
hints of the existence of such a custom in
the colonies, save in two doubtful cases. I
did not wholly like the aspect of Governor
Winthrop’s note of the suggestion of some
members of the church in Providence, that
if Goodman Verin would not give his wife
full liberty to go to meeting on Sunday
and weekly lectures as often as she wished,
“the church should dispose her to some
other man who would use her better.” I
regarded this suggestion of the Providence
Christians with shocked suspicion, but calmed
myself with the decision that it merely indicated
the disposition of Goodwife Verin as
a servant. And again, in the records of the
“Pticuler Court” of Hartford, Conn., in
1645, I discovered this entry: “Baggett
Egleston for bequething his wyfe to a young
man is fyned 20 shillings.” Now, any reader
can draw his conclusions as to exactly what
this “bequething” was, and I cannot see that
any of us can know positively. So, though
I was aware that Baggett was not a very reputable
fellow, I chose to try to persuade
myself that this exceedingly low-priced bequeathing
did not really mean wife-selling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
But just as I was “setting down satysfyed”
at the superiority in social ethics and morality
of our New England ancestors, I chanced,
while searching in the <i>Boston Evening Post</i>
of March 15, 1736, for the advertisement of
a sermon on the virtues of our forbears, entitled
<i>New England Tears and Fears of Englands
Dolours and Horrours</i>, to find instead,
by a malicious and contrary fate, this bit of
unwelcome and mortifying news not about
old England but about New England’s “dolours
and horrours.”</p>

<p>Boston. The beginning of last Week a pretty
odd and uncommon Adventure happened in this
Town, between 2 Men about a certain woman,
each one claiming her as his Wife, but so it was,
that one of them had actually disposed of his
Right in her to the other for Fifteen Shillings
this Currency, who had only paid ten of it in
part, and refus’d to pay the other Five, inclining
rather to quit the Woman and lose his Earnest;
but two Gentlemen happening to be present,
who were Friends to Peace, charitably gave him
half a Crown a piece, to enable him to fulfil his
Agreement, which the Creditor readily took, and
gave the Woman a modest Salute, wishing her
well, and his Brother Sterling much Joy of his
Bargain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>The meagre sale-money, fifteen shillings,
was the usual sum which changed hands in
England at similar transactions, though one
dame of high degree was sold for a hundred
guineas. In 1858 the <i>Stamford Mercury</i>
gave an account of a contemporary wife-sale
in England, which was announced through
the town by a bellman. The wife was led to
the sale with a halter round her neck, and
was “to be taken with all her faults.” I am
glad to say that this base British husband
was sharply punished for his misdemeanor.</p>

<p>It seems scarcely credible that the custom
still exists in England, but in 1882 a husband
sold his wife in Alfreton, Derbyshire;
and as late as the 13th July, 1887, Abraham
Boothroyd, may his name be <i>Anathema maranatha</i>,
sold his wife Clara at Sheffield, England,
for five shillings.</p>

<p>A most marked feature of social life in
colonial times was the belleship of widows.
They were literally the queens of society.
Fair maids had so little chance against them,
swains were so plentiful for widows, that I
often wonder whence came the willing men
who married the girls the first time, thus
offering themselves as the sacrifice at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
matrimonial altar through which the girls
could attain the exalted state of widowhood.
Men sighed sometimes in their callow days
for the girl friends of their own age, but as
soon as their regards were cast upon a widow,
the girls at once disappear from history, and
the triumphant widow wins the prize.</p>

<p>Another marked aspect of this condition
of society was the vast number of widows in
early days. In the South this was accounted
for by one of their own historians as being
through the universally intemperate habits
of the husbands, and consequently their frequent
early death. In all the colonies life
was hard, exposure was great to carry on any
active business, and the excessive drinking
of intoxicating liquors was not peculiar to
the Southern husbands any more than were
widows. In 1698 Boston was said to be
“full of widows and orphans, and many of
them very helpless creatures.” It was
counted that one sixth of the communicants
of Cotton Mather’s church were widows. It
is easy for us to believe this when we read
of the array of relicts among which that
aged but actively amorous gentleman, Judge
Sewall, found so much difficulty in choosing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
a marriage partner, whose personal and
financial charms he recounted with so much
pleasurable minuteness in his diary.</p>

<p>A glowing tribute to one of these Boston
widows was paid by that gossiping traveller,
John Dunton, with so much evidence of deep
interest, and even sentiment, that I fancy
Madam Dunton could not have been wholly
pleased with the writing and the printing
thereof. He called this Widow Breck the
“flower of Boston,” the “Chosen exemplar
of what a Widow is.” He extols her high
character, beauty, and resignation, and then
bridles with satisfaction while he says,
“Some have been pleas’d to say That were I
in a single state they do believe she wou’d
not be displeas’d with my addresses.” He
rode on horseback on a long journey with
his fair widow on a pillion behind him, and
if his conversation on “Platonicks and the
blisses of Matrimony” was half as tedious
as his recounting of it, the road must indeed
have seemed long. He says her love for
her dead husband is as strong as death, but
Widow Breck proved the strength of her
constancy by speedily marrying a second
husband, Michael Perry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>As an instance of the complicated family
relations which might arise in marrying
widows, let me cite the familiar case of the
rich merchant, Peter Sergeant, the builder
of the famous Province House in Boston. I
will use Mr. Shurtleff’s explanation of this
bewildering gallimaufrey of widows and
widowers:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He was as remarkable in his marriages as his
wealth; for he had three wives, the second having
been a widow twice before her third venture;
and his third also a widow, and even becoming
his widow, and lastly the widow of her third
husband.</p>
</div>

<p>To this I may add that this last husband,
Simon Stoddart, also had three wives, that
his father had four, of whom the last three
were widows,—but all this goes beyond the
modern brain to comprehend, and reminds
us most unpleasantly of the wife of Bath.</p>

<p>These frequent and speedy marriages were
not wholly owing to the exigencies of colonial
life, but were the custom of the times in
Europe as well. I read in the diary of the
Puritan John Rous, in January, 1638, of this
somewhat hasty wooing:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>A gentleman carried his wife to London last
week and died about eight o’clock at night, leaving
her five hundred pounds a year in land. The
next day before twelve she was married to the
journeyman woolen-draper that came to sell
mourning to her.</p>
</div>

<p>I do not believe John Rous made special
note of this marriage simply because it was
so speedy, but because it was unsuitable; as
a landed widow was, in social standing, far
above a journeyman draper.</p>

<p>As we approach Revolutionary days, the
reign of widows is still absolute.</p>

<p>Washington loved at fifteen a fair unknown,
supposed to be Lucy Grimes, afterward
mother of Gen. Henry Lee. To her
he wrote sentimental poems, from which we
gather (as might be expected at that age)
that he was too bashful to reveal his love.
A year later he writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I might, was my heart disengaged, pass my
time very pleasantly as there’s a very agreeable
Young Lady Lives in the same house; but as
thats only adding fuel to the fire it makes me
more uneasy; for by often and unavoidably being
in Company with her revives my former Passion
for your Lowland Beauty; whereas was I to live
more retired from young women, I might in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
measure eliviate my sorrows by burying that
chast and troublesome passion in the grave of
oblivion or eternal forgetfulness.</p>
</div>

<p>The amorous boy of sixteen managed to
“bury this chast and troublesome passion,”
to find the “Young Lady in the house”
worth looking at, and when he was twenty
years old, to write to William Fantleroy thus
of his daughter, Miss Bettie Fantleroy:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I purpose as soon as I recover my strength
(from the pleurisy) to wait on Miss Bettie in
hopes of a reconsideration of the former cruel
sentence, and to see if I cannot obtain a decision
in my favor. I enclose a letter to her.</p>
</div>

<p>Later he fell in love with Mary Phillipse,
who, though beautiful, spirited, and rich, did
not win him. This love affair is somewhat
shadowy in outline. Washington Irving
thinks that the spirit of the alert soldier
overcame the passion of the lover, and that
Washington left the lists of love for those
of battle, leaving the field to his successful
rival, Colonel Morris. The inevitable widow
in the shape of Madam Custis, with two
pretty children and a fortune of fifteen thousand
pounds sterling, became at last what he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
called his “agreeable partner for life,” and
Irving thinks she was wooed with much despatch
on account of the reverses in the Phillipse
episode.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson was another example of
a President who outlived his love-affair with
a young girl, and married in serenity a more
experienced dame. In his early correspondence
he reveals his really tumultuous passion
for one Miss Becca Burwell. He sighs like
a furnace, and bemoans his stammering
words of love, but fair Widow Martha Skelton
made him eloquent. Many lovers sighed
at her feet; two of them lingered in her
drawing-room one evening to hear her sing a
thrilling love-song to the accompaniment of
Jefferson’s violin. The love-song and music
were so expressive that the two disconsolate
swains plainly read the story of their fate,
and left the house in defeat.</p>

<p>James Madison, supposed to be an irreclaimable
old bachelor, succumbed at first
sight to the charms of fair Widow Dorothy
Todd, twenty years his junior, wooed her
with warmth, and made her, as Dolly Madison,
another Mrs. President. Benjamin
Franklin also married a widow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>The characteristic glamour which hung
round every widow encircled Widow Sarah
Syms, and Colonel Byrd gives a spirited
sketch of her in 1732:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the evening Tinsley conducted me to
Widow Syms’ house where I intended to take up
my quarters. This lady at first suspecting I was
some lover put on a gravity that becomes a weed,
but as soon as she learned who I was brightened
up with an unusual cheerfulness and serenity.
She was a portly handsome dame, of the
family of Esau, and seemed not to pine too
much for the death of her husband. This widow
is a person of lively and cheerful conversation
with much less reserve than most of her country
women. It becomes her very well and sets
off her other agreeable qualities to advantage.
We tossed off a bottle of honest port which
we relished with a broiled chicken. At nine
I retired to my devotions, and then slept so
sound that fancy itself was stupefied, else I
should have dreamed of my most obliging land-lady.</p>
</div>

<p>This “weed” who did not pine too much
for her husband, soon married again, and became
the mother of Patrick Henry; and the
testimony of Colonel Byrd as to her lively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
and cheerful conversation shows the heredity
of Patrick Henry’s “gift of tongues.”</p>

<p class="p0">was a famous Maryland belle, to whom
came a-courting two friends, young lawyers,
named Dallam and Winston. It was a day
of much masculine finery and the two impecunious
but amicable friends possessed
but one ruffled shirt between them, which
each wore on courting-day. Such amiability
deserved the reward it obtained, for,
strange to say, both suitors won Betty
Martin. Dallam was the first husband,—the
sacrifice,—and left her a widow with
three sons and a daughter. Winston did
likewise, even to the exact number of
children. Daughter Dallam’s son was Richard
Caswell, governor of South Carolina,
and member of Congress. Daughter Winston’s
son was William Paca, governor of
Maryland, and member of the Continental
Congress. Both grandsons on their way
to and from Congress always visited
their spirited old grandmother, who lived
to be some say one hundred and twenty
years old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>There must have been afforded a certain
satisfaction to a dying husband—of colonial
times—through the confidence that, by
unwavering rule, his widow would soon be
cared for and cherished by another. There
was no uncertainty as to her ultimate settlement
in life, and even should she be unfortunate
enough to lose her second partner,
he still had every reason to believe that a
third would speedily present himself. The
Reverend Jonathan Burr when almost moribund,
piously expressed himself to “that
vertuous gentlewoman his wife with confidence”
that she would soon be well provided
for; and she was, for “she was very
shortly after very honourably and comfortably
married unto a gentleman of good
estate,” a magistrate, Richard Dummer, and
lived with him nearly forty years. Provisions
were always made by a man in his
will in case his wife married again; scarcely
ever to remove the property from her, but
simply to re-adjust the division or conditions.
And men often signed ante-nuptial
contracts promising not to “meddle” with
their wives’ property. One curious law
should be noted in Pennsylvania, in 1690,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
that a widow could not marry till a year
after her husband’s death.</p>

<p>There seem to have been many advantages
in marrying a widow—she might
prove a valuable inheritance. The second
husband appeared to take a real pride in demanding
and receiving all that was due to
the defunct partner. As an example let
me give this extract from a court record.
On May 31st, 1692, the governor and council
of Maryland were thus petitioned:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>James Brown of St Marys who married the
widow and relict of Thomas Pew deceased, by
his petition humbly prays allowance for Two
Years Sallary due to his Predecessor as Publick
Post employed by the Courts, as also for the use
of a Horse, and the loss of a Servant wholly,
by the said Pew deputed in his sickness to Officiate;
and ran clear away with his Horse, some
Clothes &amp;c., and for several months after not
heard of.</p>
</div>

<p>Now we must not be over-critical, nor
hasty in judgment of the manners and motives
of two centuries ago, but those days
are held up to us as days of vast submissiveness
and modesty, of patient long-suffering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
of ignorance of extortion; yet I think we
would search far, in these degenerate days,
for a man who, having married a relict, would,
two years after his “Predecessor’s” death,
have the colossal effrontery to demand of
the government not only the back salary of
said “Predecessor,” but pay for the use of a
horse stolen by the Predecessor’s own servant—nay,
more, for the value of the said
servant who elected to run away. Truly
James Brown builded well when he chose a
wife whose departing partner had, like a
receding wave, deposited much lucrative silt
on the matrimonial shore, to be thriftily
gathered in and utilized as a bridal dower by
his not-too-sensitive successor.</p>

<p>In fact it may plainly be seen that widows
were life-saving stations in colonial social
economy; one colonist expressed his attitude
towards widows and their Providential
function as economic aids, thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Our uncle is not at present able to pay you
or any other he owes money to. If he was able
to pay he would; they must have patience till
God enable him. As his wife died in mercy
near twelve months since, it may be he may light
of some rich widow that may make him capable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
to pay; except God in this way raise him he cannot
pay you or any one else.</p>
</div>

<p>It certainly must have been some satisfaction
to every woman to feel within herself
the possibility of becoming such a celestial
agent of material salvation.</p>

<p>I wish to state, in passing, that it is sometimes
difficult to judge as to the marital
estate of some dames, to know whether they
were widows at the time of the second marriage
or not, for the prefixed Mrs. was used
indifferently for married and single women,
and even for young girls. Cotton Mather
wrote of “Mrs. Sarah Gerrish, a very beautiful
and ingenious damsel seven years of
age.” Rev. Mr. Tompson wrote a funeral
tribute to a little girl of six, which is entitled
and begins thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A Neighbors Tears dropt on ye grave of an
Amiable Virgin, a pleasant Plant cut down in

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>The pious old minister did not really mean
by this tribute to the old-school doctors,
that Mrs. Rebecka would have achieved
earthly immortality. He modestly ends his
poetic tribute thus:—</p>

<p>The honest and kindly gentlemen who were
their husbands, sounded their virtues in
diaries and letters; godly ministers preached
their piety in labored and dry-as-dust sermons.
Their charms were sung by colonial
poets in elegies, anagrams, epicediums, acrostics,
threnodies, and other decorous verse.
It was reserved for a man of war, and not a
very godly man of war either, to pæan their
good sense. Cervantes says that “womans
counsel is not worth much, yet he who despises
it is no wiser than he should be.”
With John Underhill’s more gallant tribute
to the counsel of a consort, we may fitly end
this chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Myself received an arrow through my coat
sleeve, a second against my helmet on the forehead;
so as if God in his Providence had not
moved the heart of my wife to persuade me to
carry it along with me (which I was unwilling to
do) I had been slain. Give me leave to observe
two things from hence; first when the hour of
death is not yet come, you see God useth weak
means to keep his purpose unviolated; secondly
let no man despise advice and counsel of his
wife though she be a woman. It were strange to
nature to think a man should be bound to fulfil
the humour of a woman, what arms he should
carry; but you see God will have it so, that a
woman should overcome a man. What with
Delilahs flattery, and with her mournful tears,
they must and will have their desire, when the
hand of God goes along in the matter, and this
to accomplish his own will. Therefore let the
clamor be quenched that I hear daily in my ears,
that New England men usurp over their wives
and keep them in servile subjection. The country
is wronged in this matter as in many things
else. Let this precedent satisfy the doubtful,
for that comes from the example of a rude soldier.
If they be so courteous to their wives as
to take their advice in warlike matters, how
much more kind is the tender affectionate husband
to honor his wife as the weaker vessel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Yet mistake not. I say not they are bound to
call their wives in council, though they are bound
to take their private advice (so far as they
see it make for their advantage
and good). Instance
Abraham.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br><span class="small">WOMEN OF AFFAIRS.</span></h2></div>


<p>The early history of Maryland seems
singularly peaceful when contrasted
with that of other colonies. There were few
Indian horrors, few bitter quarrels, comparatively
few petty offences. In spite of the
influx of convicts, there was a notable absence
of the shocking crimes and equally
shocking punishments which appear on the
court records of other provinces; it is also
true that there were few schools and
churches, and but scanty intellectual activity.
Against that comparatively peaceful background
stands out one of the most remarkable
figures of early colonial life in America—Margaret
Brent; a woman who seemed
more fitted for our day than her own. She
was the first woman in America to demand
suffrage, a vote, and representation.</p>

<p>She came to the province in 1638 with her
sister Mary (another shrewd and capable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
woman), her two brothers, and nine other
colonists. The sisters at once took up land,
built manorhouses, and shortly brought over
more colonists; soon the court-baron and
court-leet were held at Mary Brent’s home,
St. Gabriel’s Manor, on old Kent Island.
We at once hear of the sisters as active in
business affairs, registering cattle marks,
buying and selling property, attending with
success to important matters for their brothers;
and Margaret soon signed herself
“Attorney for my brother, &amp;c., &amp;c.,” and
was allowed the right so to act. The Brents
were friends and probably kinsfolk of Lord
Baltimore, and intimate friends, also, of the
governor of Maryland, Leonard Calvert.
When the latter died in 1647, he appointed by
nuncupation one Thomas Greene as his successor
as governor, and Margaret Brent as
his sole executrix, with the laconic instruction
to “Take all and Pay all,” and to give
one Mistress Temperance Pypott a mare
colt. His estate was small, and if he had
made Greene executor, and Mistress Margaret
governor, he would have done a much
more sensible thing; for Greene was vacillating
and weak, and when an emergency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
arose, he had to come to Margaret Brent for
help. The soldiers, who had assisted the
government in recent troubles, were still unpaid,
and Governor Calvert had pledged his
official word and the property of Lord Baltimore
that they should be paid in full. After
his death an insurrection in the army seemed
rising, when Mistress Brent calmly stepped
in, sold cattle belonging to the Proprietary,
and paid off the small but angry army. This
was not the only time she quelled an incipient
mutiny. Her kinsman, Lord Baltimore,
was inclined to find bitter fault, and wrote
“tartly” when the news of her prompt action
and attendant expenditure reached his ears;
but the Assembly sent him a letter, gallantly
upholding Mistress Brent in her “meddling,”
saying with inadvertent humour, that his
estate fared better in her hands than “any
man elses.”</p>

<p>Her astonishing stand for woman’s rights
was made on January 21, 1647-48, two centuries
and a half ago, and was thus recorded:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Came Mrs Margaret Brent and requested to
have vote in the House for herself and voyce
allsoe, for that on the last Court 3rd January it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
was ordered that the said Mrs Brent was to be
looked upon and received as his Ldp’s Attorney.
The Governor deny’d that the s’d Mrs Brent
should have any vote in the house. And the s’d
Mrs Brent protested against all proceedings in
this present Assembly unlesse she may be present
and have vote as afores’d.</p>
</div>

<p>With this protest for representation, and
demand for her full rights, this remarkable
woman does not disappear from our ken.
We hear of her in 1651 as an offender, having
been accused of killing wild cattle and
selling the beef. She asserted with vigor
and dignity that the cattle were her own, and
demanded a trial by jury.</p>

<p>And in 1658 she makes her last curtsey
before the Assembly and ourselves, a living
proof of the fallacy of the statement that
men do not like strong-minded women. For
at that date, at the fully ripened age of fifty-seven,
she appeared as heir of an estate bequeathed
to her by a Maryland gentleman as
a token of his love and affection, and of his
constant wish to marry her. She thus vanishes
out of history, in a thoroughly feminine
rôle, that of a mourning sweetheart; yet
standing signally out of colonial days as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
most clear-cut, unusual, and forceful figure
of the seventeenth century in Maryland.</p>

<p>Another Maryland woman of force and
fearlessness was Verlinda Stone. A letter
from her to Lord Baltimore is still in the
Maryland archives, demanding an investigation
of a fight in Anne Arundel County, in
which her husband was wounded. The letter
is businesslike enough, but ends in a
fiery postscript in which she uses some pretty
strong terms. Such women as these were
not to be trifled with; as Alsop wrote:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All Complemental Courtships drest up in critical
Rarities are meer Strangers to them. Plain
wit comes nearest to their Genius, so that he
that intends to Court a Maryland girle, must
have something more than the tautologies of a
long-winded speech to carry on his design.</p>
</div>

<p>Elizabeth Haddon was another remarkable
woman; she founded Haddonfield, New Jersey.
Her father had become possessed of a
tract of land in the New World, and she
volunteered to come alone to the colony, and
settle upon the land. She did so in 1701
when she was but <i>nineteen years old</i>, and
conducted herself and her business with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
judgment, discretion, and success, and so
continued throughout her long life. She
married a young Quaker named Esthaugh,
who may have been one of the attractions of
the New World. Her idealized story has
been told by L. Maria Child in her book
<i>The Youthful Emigrant</i>.</p>

<p>John Clayton, writing as early as 1688 of
“Observables” in Virginia, tells of several
“acute ingenious gentlewomen” who carried
on thriving tobacco-plantations, draining
swamps and raising cattle and buying slaves.
One near Jamestown was a fig-raiser.</p>

<p>In all the Southern colonies we find these
acute gentlewomen taking up tracts of land,
clearing them, and cultivating their holdings.
In the settlement of Pennsylvania,
Mary Tewee took two thousand five hundred
acres in what is now Lancaster County. She
was the widow of a French Huguenot gentleman,
the friend of William Penn, and had
been presented at the court of Queen Anne.</p>

<p>New England magistrates did not encourage
such independence. In the early days
of Salem, “maid-lotts” were granted to single
women, but stern Endicott wrote that it
was best to abandon the custom, and “avoid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
all presedents &amp; evil events of granting lotts
vnto single maidens not disposed of.” The
town of Taunton, Mass., had an “ancient
maid” of forty-eight years for its founder,
one Elizabeth Poole; and Winthrop says she
endured much hardship. Her gravestone
says she was a “native of old England of
good family, friends and prospects, all of
which she left in the prime of her life to enjoy
the religion of her conscience in this distant
wilderness. A great proprietor of the
township of Taunton, a chief promoter of
its settlement in 1639. Having employed
the opportunity of her virgin state in piety,
liberality and sanctity of manners, she died
aged 65.”</p>

<p>Lady Deborah Moody did not receive from
the Massachusetts magistrates an over-cordial
or very long-lived welcome. She is described
as a “harassed and lonely widow voluntarily
exiling herself for conscience’ sake.” Perhaps
her running in debt for her Swampscott
land and her cattle had quite as much to do
with her unpopularity as her “error of denying
infant baptism.” But as she paid nine
hundred or some say eleven hundred pounds
for that wild land, it is no wonder she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
“almost undone.” She was dealt with by
the elders, and admonished by the church,
but she “persisted” and finally removed to
the Dutch, against the advice of all her
friends. Endicott called her a dangerous
woman, but Winthrop termed her a “wise
and anciently religious woman.” Among
the Dutch she found a congenial home, and,
unmolested, she planned on her Gravesend
farm a well-laid-out city, but did not live to
carry out her project. A descendant of one
of her Dutch neighbors writes of her:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tradition says she was buried in the north-west
corner of the Gravesend church yard. Upon
the headstone of those who sleep beside her we
read the inscription <i>In der Heere entslapen</i>—they
sleep in the Lord. We may say the same of this
brave true woman, she sleeps in the Lord. Her
rest has been undisturbed in this quiet spot
which she hoped to make a great city.</p>
</div>

<p>It seems to be plain that the charge of the
affairs of Governor John Winthrop, Jr., in
New Haven was wholly in the hands of Mrs.
Davenport, the wife of the minister, Rev.
John Davenport. Many sentences in her
husband’s letters show her cares for her
friends’ welfare, the variety of her business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
duties, and her performance of them. He
wrote thus to the Governor in 1658:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For your ground; my wife speedily, even the
same day she received your letter, spake with
sundry about it, and received this answer, that
there is no Indian corne to be planted in that
quarter this yeare. Brother Boykin was willing
to have taken it, but saith it is overrun with wild
sorrell and it will require time to subdue it, and
put it into tillage, being at present unfit to be improved.
Goodman Finch was in our harbour
when your letter came, &amp; my wife went promptly
downe, and met with yong Mr Lamberton to
whom she delivered your letter. He offered
some so bad beaver that my wife would not take
it. My wife spake twise to him herself. My
wife desireth to add that she received for you of
Mr Goodenhouse 30s worth of beaver &amp; 4s in
wampum. She purposeth to send your beaver to
the Baye when the best time is, to sell it for your
advantage and afterwards to give you an account
what it comes to. Your letter to Sarjiunt Baldwin
my wife purposeth to carry to him by the 1st
opportunity. Sister Hobbadge has paid my wife
in part of her debt to you a bushel of winter
wheate.</p>
</div>

<p>The letters also reveal much loving-kindness,
much eagerness to be of assistance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
equal readiness to welcome new-comers, and
to smooth the rough difficulties in pioneer
housekeeping. Rev. Mr. Davenport wrote
in August, 1655, from New Haven to Gov.
Winthrop at Pequot:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Hon’ᵈ Sir</span>,—We did earnestly expect your
coming hither with Mrs. Winthrop and your familie,
the last light moone, having intelligence
that a vessel wayted upon you at Pequot for that
end, and were thereby encouraged to provide
your house, that it might be fitted in some
measure, for your comfortable dwelling in it,
this winter.</p>

<p>My wife was not wanting in her endeavors
to set all wheeles in going, all hands that she
could procure on worke, that you might find all
things to your satisfaction. Though she could
not accomplish her desires to the full, yet she
proceeded as farr as she could; whereby many
things are done viz. the house made warme, the
well cleansed, the pumpe fitted for your use, some
provision of wood layed in, and 20 loades will be
ready, whensoever you come; and sundry, by my
wife’s instigation, prepared 30 bush. of wheate for
the present and sister Glover hath 12 lb of candles
ready for you. My wife hath also procured
a maid servant for you, who is reported to be
cleanly and saving, her mother is of the church,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and she is kept from a place in Connectacot
where she was much desired, to serve you....</p>

<p>If Mrs. Winthrop knew how wellcome she
will be to us she would I believe neglect whatsoever
others doe or may be forward to suggest for
her discouragement. Salute her, with due respect,
in my name and my wife’s, most affectionately.</p>
</div>

<p>Madam Davenport also furnished the
rooms with tables and “chayres,” and “took
care of yor apples that they may be kept
safe from the frost that Mrs. Winthrop may
have the benefit of them,” and arranged
to send horses to meet them; so it is not
strange to learn in a postscript that the
hospitable kindly soul, who thus cheerfully
worked to “redd the house,” had a “paine
in the soles of her feet, especially in the
evening;” and a little later on to know she
was “valetudinarious, faint, thirsty, of little
appetite <i>yet cheerful</i>.”</p>

<p>All these examples, and many others help
to correct one very popular mistake. It
seems to be universally believed that the
“business woman” is wholly a product of the
nineteenth century. Most emphatically may
it be affirmed that such is not the case. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
have seen advertisements dating from 1720 to
1800, chiefly in New England newspapers, of
women teachers, embroiderers, jelly-makers,
cooks, wax-workers, japanners, mantua-makers,—all
truly feminine employments; and
also of women dealers in crockery, musical
instruments, hardware, farm products, groceries,
drugs, wines, and spirits, while Hawthorne
noted one colonial dame who carried
on a blacksmith-shop. Peter Faneuil’s account
books show that he had accounts in
small English wares with many Boston
tradeswomen, some of whom bought many
thousand pounds’ worth of imported goods
in a year. Alice Quick had fifteen hundred
pounds in three months; and I am glad to
say that the women were very prompt in
payment, as well as active in business. By
Stamp Act times, the names of five women
merchants appear on the Salem list of traders
who banded together to oppose taxation.</p>

<p>It is claimed by many that the “newspaper-woman”
is a growth of modern times.
I give examples to prove the fallacy of this
statement. Newspapers of colonial times
can scarcely be said to have been edited, they
were simply printed or published, and all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
men did as newspaper-publishers, women did
also, and did well. It cannot be asserted that
these women often voluntarily or primarily
started a newspaper; they usually assumed
the care after the death of an editor husband,
or brother, or son, or sometimes to assist
while a male relative, through sickness or
multiplicity of affairs, could not attend to his
editorial or publishing work.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable examples of
women-publishers may be found in the Goddard
family of Rhode Island. Mrs. Sarah
Goddard was the daughter of Ludowick Updike,
of one of the oldest and most respected
families in that State. She received an excellent
education “in both useful and polite
learning,” and married Dr. Giles Goddard, a
prominent physician and postmaster of New
London. After becoming a widow, she went
into the printing business in Providence
about the year 1765, with her son, who was
postmaster of that town. They published the
<i>Providence Gazette and Country Journal</i>, the
only newspaper printed in Providence before
1775. William Goddard was dissatisfied
with his pecuniary profit, and he went to
New York, leaving the business wholly with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
his mother; she conducted it with much ability
and success under the name Sarah Goddard
&amp; Company. I wish to note that she
carried on this business not under her son’s
name, but openly in her own behalf; and
when she assumed the charge of the paper,
she printed it with her own motto as the
heading, <i>Vox Populi Vox Dei</i>.</p>

<p>William Goddard drifted to Philadelphia,
where he published the <i>Pennsylvania Chronicle</i>
for a short season, and in 1773 he removed
to Baltimore and established himself
in the newspaper business anew, with only,
he relates, “the small capital of a single solitary
guinea.” He found another energetic
business woman, the widow Mrs. Nicholas
Hasselbaugh, carrying on the printing-business
bequeathed to her by her husband;
and he bought her stock in trade and established
<i>The Maryland Journal and Baltimore
Advertiser</i>. It was the third newspaper published
in Maryland, was issued weekly at ten
shillings per annum, and was a well-printed
sheet. But William Goddard had another
bee in his bonnet. A plan was formed just
before the Revolutionary War to abolish the
general public post-office and to establish in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
its place a complete private system of post-riders
from Georgia to New Hampshire.
This system was to be supported by private
subscription; a large sum was already subscribed,
and the scheme well under way,
when the war ended all the plans. Goddard
had this much to heart, and had travelled
extensively through the colonies exploiting
it. While he was away on these trips he
left the newspaper and printing-house solely
under the charge of his sister Mary Katharine
Goddard, the worthy daughter of
her energetic mother. From 1775 to 1784,
through the trying times of the Revolution,
and in a most active scene of military and
political troubles, this really brilliant woman
continued to print successfully and continuously
her newspaper. The <i>Journal</i> and
every other work issued from her printing-presses
were printed and published in her
name, and it is believed chiefly on her own
account. She was a woman of much intelligence
and was also practical, being an expert
compositor of types, and fully conversant
with every detail of the mechanical
work of a printing-office. During this busy
time she was also postmistress of Baltimore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
and kept a bookshop. Her brother William,
through his futile services in this postal
scheme, had been led to believe he would receive
under Benjamin Franklin and the new
government of the United States, the appointment
of Secretary and Comptroller of
the Post Office; but Franklin gave it to his
own son-in-law, Richard Bache. Goddard,
sorely disappointed but pressed in money
matters, felt forced to accept the position of
Surveyor of Post Roads. When Franklin
went to France in 1776, and Bache became
Postmaster-General, and Goddard again was
not appointed Comptroller, his chagrin caused
him to resign his office, and naturally to
change his political principles.</p>

<p>He retired to Baltimore, and soon there
appeared in the <i>Journal</i> an ironical piece
(written by a member of Congress) signed
Tom Tell Truth. From this arose a vast
political storm. The Whig Club of Baltimore,
a powerful body, came to Miss Goddard
and demanded the name of the author;
she referred them to her brother. On his
refusal to give the author’s name, he was
seized, carried to the clubhouse, bullied, and
finally warned out of town and county. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
at once went to the Assembly at Annapolis
and demanded protection, which was given
him. He ventilated his wrongs in a pamphlet,
and was again mobbed and insulted.
In 1779, Anna Goddard printed anonymously
in her paper <i>Queries Political and
Military</i>, written really by General Charles
Lee, the enemy and at one time presumptive
rival of Washington. This paper also
raised a tremendous storm through which
the Goddards passed triumphantly. Lee
remained always a close friend of William
Goddard, and bequeathed to him his valuable
and interesting papers, with the intent
of posthumous publication; but, unfortunately,
they were sent to England to be
printed in handsome style, and were instead
imperfectly and incompletely issued, and
William Goddard received no benefit or
profit from their sale. But Lee left him
also, by will, a large and valuable estate in
Berkeley County, Virginia, so he retired
from public life and ended his days on a
Rhode Island farm. Anna Katharine Goddard
lived to great old age. The story of
this acquaintance with General Lee, and of
Miss Goddard’s connection therewith, forms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
one of the interesting minor episodes of the
War.</p>

<p>Just previous to the Revolution, it was
nothing very novel or unusual to Baltimoreans
to see a woman edit a newspaper. The
<i>Maryland Gazette</i> suspended on account of
the Stamp Act in 1765, and the printer issued
a paper called <i>The Apparition of the
Maryland Gazette which is not Dead but
Sleepeth</i>; and instead of a Stamp it bore a
death’s head with the motto, “The Times
are Dismal, Doleful, Dolorous, Dollarless.”
Almost immediately after it resumed publication,
the publisher died, and from 1767
to 1775 it was carried on by his widow,
Anne Katharine Green, sometimes assisted
by her son, but for five years alone. The
firm name was Anne Katharine Green &amp;
Son: and she also did the printing for the
Colony. She was about thirty-six years old
when she assumed the business, and was
then the mother of six sons and eight daughters.
Her husband was the fourth generation
from Samuel Green, the first printer in
New England, from whom descended about
thirty ante-Revolutionary printers. Until
the Revolution there was always a Printer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
Green in Boston. Mr. Green’s partner, William
Rind, removed to Williamsburg and
printed there the <i>Virginia Gazette</i>. At his
death, widow Clementina Rind, not to be
outdone by Widow Green and Mother and
Sister Goddard, proved that what woman
has done woman can do, by carrying on the
business and printing the <i>Gazette</i> till her
own death in 1775.</p>

<p>It is indeed a curious circumstance that,
on the eve of the Revolution, so many
southern newspapers should be conducted by
women. Long ere that, from 1738 to 1740,
Elizabeth Timothy, a Charleston woman,
widow of Louis Timothy, the first librarian
of the Philadelphia Library company, and
publisher of the <i>South Carolina Gazette</i>,
carried on that paper after her husband’s
death; and her son, Peter Timothy, succeeded
her. In 1780 his paper was suspended,
through his capture by the British.
He was exchanged, and was lost at sea with
two daughters and a grandchild, while on
his way to Antigua to obtain funds. He
had a varied and interesting life, was a friend
of Parson Whitefield, and was tried with
him on a charge of libel against the South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Carolina ministers. In 1782 his widow,
Anne Timothy, revived the <i>Gazette</i>, as had
her mother-in-law before her, and published
it successfully twice a week for ten years
till her death in 1792. She had a large
printing-house, corner of Broad and King
Streets, Charleston, and was printer to the
State; truly a remarkable woman.</p>

<p>Peter Timothy’s sister Mary married
Charles Crouch, who also was drowned when
on a vessel bound to New York. He was a
sound Whig and set up a paper in opposition
to the Stamp Act, called <i>The South
Carolina Gazette and Country Journal</i>.
This was one of the four papers which were
all entitled Gazettes in order to secure certain
advertisements that were all directed
by law “to be inserted in the South Carolina
Gazette.” Mary Timothy Crouch continued
the paper for a short time after her
husband’s death; and in 1780 shortly before
the surrender of the city to the British, went
with her printing-press and types to Salem,
where for a few months she printed <i>The
Salem Gazette and General Advertiser</i>. I
have dwelt at some length on the activity
and enterprise of these Southern women,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
because it is another popular but unstable
notion that the women of the North were
far more energetic and capable than their
Southern sisters; which is certainly not the
case in this line of business affairs.</p>

<p>Benjamin and James Franklin were not
the only members of the Franklin family
who were capable newspaper-folk. James
Franklin died in Newport in 1735, and his
widow Anne successfully carried on the business
for many years. She had efficient aid
in her two daughters, who were quick and
capable practical workers at the compositor’s
case, having been taught by their father,
whom they assisted in his lifetime. Isaiah
Thomas says of them:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A gentleman who was acquainted with Anne
Franklin and her family, informed me that he
had often seen her daughters at work in the
printing house, and that they were sensible and
amiable women.</p>
</div>

<p>We can well believe that, since they had
Franklin and Anne Franklin blood in them.
This competent and industrious trio of women
not only published the <i>Newport Mercury</i>,
but were printers for the colony, supplying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
blanks for public offices, publishing pamphlets,
etc. In 1745 they printed for the Government
an edition of the laws of the colony
of 340 pages, folio. Still further, they carried
on a business of “printing linens, calicoes,
silks, &amp;c., in figures, very lively and
durable colors, and without the offensive
smell which commonly attends linen-printing.”
Surely there was no lack of business
ability on the distaff side of the Franklin
house.</p>

<p>Boston women gave much assistance to
their printer-husbands. Ezekiel Russel, the
editor of that purely political publication,
<i>The Censor</i>, was in addition a printer of
chap-books and ballads which were sold from
his stand near the Liberty Tree on Boston
Common. His wife not only helped him in
printing these, but she and another young
woman of his household, having ready pens
and a biddable muse, wrote with celerity
popular and seasonable ballads on passing
events, especially of tragic or funereal cast;
and when these ballads were printed with a
nice border of woodcuts of coffins and death’s
heads, they often had a long and profitable
run of popularity. After his death, Widow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
Russel still continued ballad making and
monging.</p>

<p>It was given to a woman, Widow Margaret
Draper, to publish the only newspaper which
was issued in Boston during the siege, the
<i>Massachusetts Gazette and Boston News
Letter</i>. And a miserable little sheet it was,
vari-colored, vari-typed, vari-sized; of such
poor print that it is scarcely readable. When
the British left Boston, Margaret Draper left
also, and resided in England, where she received
a pension from the British government.</p>

<p>The first newspaper in Pennsylvania was
entitled <i>The American Weekly Mercury</i>. It
was “imprinted by Andrew Bradford” in
1719. He was a son of the first newspaper
printer in New York, William Bradford,
Franklin’s “cunning old fox,” who lived to
be ninety-two years old, and whose quaint
tombstone may be seen in Trinity Churchyard.
At Andrew’s death in 1742, the paper
appeared in mourning, and it was announced
that it would be published by “the widow
Bradford.” She took in a partner, but speedily
dropped him, and carried it on in her own
name till 1746. During the time that Cornelia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
Bradford printed this paper it was remarkable
for its good type and neatness.</p>

<p><i>The Connecticut Courant</i> and <i>The Centinel</i>
were both of them published for some years
by the widows of former proprietors.</p>

<p>The story of John Peter Zenger, the publisher
of <i>The New York Weekly Journal</i>,
is one of the most interesting episodes in
our progress to free speech and liberty, but
cannot be dwelt on here. The feminine portion
of his family was of assistance to him.
His daughter was mistress of a famous New
York tavern that saw many remarkable visitors,
and heard much of the remarkable talk
of Zenger’s friends. After his death in 1746,
his newspaper was carried on by his widow
for two years. Her imprint was, “New
York; Printed by the Widow Cathrine
Zenger at the Printing-Office in Stone
Street; Where Advertisements are taken
in, and all Persons may be supplied with this
Paper.”</p>

<p>The whole number of newspapers printed
before the Revolution was not very large;
and when we see how readily and successfully
this considerable number of women
assumed the cares of publishing, we know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
that the “newspaper woman” of that day
was no rare or presumptuous creature, any
more than is the “newspaper-woman” of
our own day, albeit she was of very different
ilk; but the spirit of independent self-reliance,
when it became necessary to exhibit
self-reliance, was as prompt and as stable in
the feminine breast a century and a half ago
as now. Then, as to-day, there were doubtless
scores of good wives and daughters who
materially assisted their husbands in their
printing-shops, and whose work will never be
known.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that our great-grandmothers
possessed wonderful ability to manage
their own affairs, when it became necessary
to do so, even in extended commercial
operations. It is easy to trace in the New
England coast towns one influence which
tended to interest them, and make them capable
of business transactions. They constantly
heard on all sides the discussion of
foreign trade, and were even encouraged to
enter into the discussion and the traffic.
They heard the Windward Islands, the Isle
of France, and Amsterdam, and Canton, and
the coast of Africa described by old travelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
mariners, by active young shipmasters, in a
way that put them far more in touch with
these far-away foreign shores, gave them
more knowledge of details of life in those
lands, than women of to-day have. And
women were encouraged, even urged, to take
an active share in foreign trade, in commercial
speculation, by sending out a “venture”
whenever a vessel put out to sea, and whenever
the small accumulation of money earned
by braiding straw, knitting stockings, selling
eggs or butter, or by spinning and weaving,
was large enough to be worth thus investing;
and it needed not to be a very large sum to
be deemed proper for investment. When a
ship sailed out to China with cargo of ginseng,
the ship’s owner did not own all the
solid specie in the hold—the specie that was
to be invested in the rich and luxurious products
of far Cathay. Complicated must have
been the accounts of these transactions, for
many were the parties in the speculation.
There were no giant monopolies in those
days. The kindly ship-owner permitted even
his humblest neighbor to share his profits.
And the profits often were large. The
stories of some of the voyages, the adventures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
of the business contracts, read like a
fairy tale of commerce. In old letters may
be found reference to many of the ventures
sent by women. One young woman wrote
in 1759:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Inclos’d is a pair of Earrings. Pleas ask
Captin Oliver to carry them a Ventur fer me if
he Thinks they will fetch anything to the Vally
of them; tell him he may bring the effects in
anything he thinks will answer best.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the “effects” brought to this
young woman, and to hundreds of others,
was a certain acquaintance with business
transactions, a familiarity with the methods
of trade. When the father or husband died,
the woman could, if necessary, carry on his
business to a successful winding-up, or continue
it in the future. Of the latter enterprise
many illustrations might be given. In
the autumn of 1744 a large number of prominent
business men in Newport went into a
storehouse on a wharf to examine the outfit
of a large privateer. A terrible explosion of
gunpowder took place, which killed nine of
them. One of the wounded was Sueton
Grant, a Scotchman, who had come to America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
in 1725. His wife, on hearing of the accident,
ran at once to the dock, took in at a
glance the shocking scene and its demands
for assistance, and cutting into strips her
linen apron with the housewife’s scissors she
wore at her side, calmly bound up the wounds
of her dying husband. Mr. Grant was at this
time engaged in active business; he had
agencies in Europe, and many privateers
afloat. Mrs. Grant took upon her shoulders
these great responsibilities, and successfully
carried them on for many years, while she educated
her children, and cared for her home.</p>

<p>A good example of her force of character
was once shown in a court of law. She had
an important litigation on hand and large
interests at stake, when she discovered the
duplicity of her counsel, and her consequent
danger. She went at once to the court-room
where the case was being tried; when
her lawyer promptly but vainly urged her to
retire. The judge, disturbed by the interruption,
asked for an explanation, and Mrs.
Grant at once unfolded the knavery of her
counsel and asked permission to argue her
own case. Her dignity, force, and lucidity
so moved the judge that he permitted her to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
address the jury, which she did in so convincing
a manner as to cause them to
promptly render a verdict favorable to her.
She passed through some trying scenes at
the time of the Revolution with wonderful
decision and ability, and received from every
one the respect and deference due to a
thorough business man, though she was a
woman.</p>

<p>In New York the feminine Dutch blood
showed equal capacity in business matters;
and it is said that the management of considerable
estates and affairs often was assumed
by widows in New Amsterdam. Two
noted examples are Widow De Vries and
Widow Provoost. The former was married
in 1659, to Rudolphus De Vries, and after
his death she carried on his Dutch trade—not
only buying and selling foreign goods,
but going repeatedly to Holland in the position
of supercargo on her own ships. She
married Frederick Phillipse, and it was
through her keenness and thrift and her profitable
business, as well as through his own
success, that Phillipse became the richest
man in the colony and acquired the largest
West Indian trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>Widow Maria Provoost was equally successful
at the beginning of the eighteenth
century, and had a vast Dutch business correspondence.
Scarce a ship from Spain,
the Mediterranean, or the West Indies, but
brought her large consignments of goods.
She too married a second time, and as
Madam James Alexander filled a most dignified
position in New York, being the only
person besides the Governor to own a two-horse
coach. Her house was the finest in
town, and such descriptions of its various
apartments as “the great drawing-room, the
lesser drawing-room, the blue and gold
leather room, the green and gold leather
room, the chintz room, the great tapestry
room, the little front parlour, the back parlour,”
show its size and pretensions.</p>

<p>Madam Martha Smith, widow of Colonel
William Smith of St. George’s Manor, Long
Island, was a woman of affairs in another
field. In an interesting memorandum left
by her we read:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jan ye 16, 1707. My company killed a yearling
whale made 27 barrels. Feb ye 4, Indian
Harry with his boat struck a whale and called
for my boat to help him. I had but a third which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
was 4 barrels. Feb 22, my two boats &amp; my sons
and Floyds boats killed a yearling whale of which
I had half—made 36 barrels, my share 18 barrels.
Feb 24 my company killed a school whale
which made 35 barrels. March 13, my company
killed a small yearling made 30 barrels. March
17, my company killed two yearlings in one day;
one made 27, the other 14 barrels.</p>
</div>

<p>We find her paying to Lord Cornbury fifteen
pounds, a duty on “ye 20th part of her
eyle.” And she apparently succeeded in her
enterprises.</p>

<p>In early Philadelphia directories may be
found the name of “Margaret Duncan,
Merchant, No. 1 S. Water St.” This capable
woman had been shipwrecked on her
way to the new world. In the direst hour
of that extremity, when forced to draw lots
for the scant supply of food, she vowed to
build a church in her new home if her life
should be spared. The “Vow Church” in
Philadelphia, on Thirteenth Street near Market
Street, for many years proved her fulfilment
of this vow, and also bore tribute to
the prosperity of this pious Scotch Presbyterian
in her adopted home.</p>

<p>Southern women were not outstripped by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
the business women of the north. No more
practical woman ever lived in America than
Eliza Lucas Pinckney. When a young girl
she resided on a plantation at Wappoo,
South Carolina, owned by her father, George
Lucas. He was Governor of Antigua, and
observing her fondness for and knowledge
of botany, and her intelligent power of application
of her knowledge, he sent to her
many tropical seeds and plants for her
amusement and experiment in her garden.
Among the seeds were some of indigo, which
she became convinced could be profitably
grown in South Carolina. She at once determined
to experiment, and planted indigo
seed in March, 1741. The young plants
started finely, but were cut down by an unusual
frost. She planted seed a second
time, in April, and these young indigo-plants
were destroyed by worms. Notwithstanding
these discouragements, she tried a third
time, and with success. Her father was
delighted with her enterprise and persistence,
and when he learned that the indigo
had seeded and ripened, sent an Englishman
named Cromwell—an experienced indigo-worker—from
Montserrat to teach his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
daughter Eliza the whole process of extracting
the dye from the weed. Vats were built
on Wappoo Creek, in which was made the
first indigo formed in Carolina. It was of
indifferent quality, for Cromwell feared the
successful establishment of the industry in
America would injure the indigo trade in
his own colony, so he made a mystery of the
process, and put too much lime in the vats,
doubtless thinking he could impose upon a
woman. But Miss Lucas watched him carefully,
and in spite of his duplicity, and
doubtless with considerable womanly power
of guessing, finally obtained a successful
knowledge and application of the complex
and annoying methods of extracting indigo,—methods
which required the untiring attention
of sleepless nights, and more “judgment”
than intricate culinary triumphs.
After the indigo was thoroughly formed by
steeping, beating, and washing, and taken
from the vats, the trials of the maker were
not over. It must be exposed to the sun, but
if exposed too much it would be burnt, if
too little it would rot. Myriads of flies collected
around it and if unmolested would
quickly ruin it. If packed too soon it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
sweat and disintegrate. So, from the first
moment the tender plant appeared above
ground, when the vast clouds of destroying
grasshoppers had to be annihilated by flocks
of hungry chickens, or carefully dislodged
by watchful human care, indigo culture and
manufacture was a distressing worry, and
was made still more unalluring to a feminine
experimenter by the fact that during the
weary weeks it laid in the “steepers” and
“beaters” it gave forth a most villainously
offensive smell.</p>

<p>Soon after Eliza Lucas’ hard-earned success
she married Charles Pinckney, and it is
pleasant to know that her father gave her,
as part of her wedding gift, all the indigo on
the plantation. She saved the whole crop
for seed,—and it takes about a bushel of
indigo seed to plant four acres,—and she
planted the Pinckney plantation at Ashepoo,
and gave to her friends and neighbors small
quantities of seed for individual experiment;
all of which proved successful. The culture
of indigo at once became universal, the newspapers
were full of instructions upon the
subject, and the dye was exported to England
by 1747, in such quantity that merchants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
trading in Carolina petitioned Parliament for
a bounty on Carolina indigo. An act of
Parliament was passed allowing a bounty of
sixpence a pound on indigo raised in the
British-American plantations and imported
directly to Great Britain. Spurred on by
this wise act, the planters applied with redoubled
vigor to the production of the article,
and soon received vast profits as the rewards
of their labor and care. It is said that just
previous to the Revolution more children
were sent from South Carolina to England
to receive educations, than from all the other
colonies,—and this through the profits of
indigo and rice. Many indigo planters
doubled their capital every three or four
years, and at last not only England was supplied
with indigo from South Carolina, but
the Americans undersold the French in
many European markets. It exceeded all
other southern industries in importance, and
became a general medium of exchange.
When General Marion’s young nephew was
sent to school at Philadelphia, he started off
with a wagon-load of indigo to pay his expenses.
The annual dues of the Winyah
Indigo Society of Georgetown were paid in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
the dye, and the society had grown so
wealthy in 1753, that it established a large
charity school and valuable library.</p>

<p>Ramsay, the historian of South Carolina,
wrote in 1808, that the indigo trade proved
more beneficial to Carolina than the mines of
Mexico or Peru to old or new Spain. By
the year of his writing, however, indigo
(without waiting for extermination through
its modern though less reliable rivals, the
aniline dyes) had been driven out of Southern
plantations by its more useful and profitable
field neighbor, King Cotton, that had
been set on a throne by the invention of a
Yankee schoolmaster. The time of greatest
production and export of indigo was just
previous to the Revolution, and at one time
it was worth four or five dollars a pound.
And to-day only the scanty records of the
indigo trade, a few rotting cypress boards of
the steeping-vats, and the blue-green leaves
of the wild wayside indigo, remain of all
this prosperity to show the great industry
founded by this remarkable and intelligent
woman.</p>

<p>The rearing of indigo was not this young
girl’s only industry. I will quote from various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
letters written by her in 1741 and 1742
before her marriage, to show her many
duties, her intelligence, her versatility:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Wrote my father on the pains I had taken to
bring the Indigo, Ginger, Cotton, Lucern, and
Casada to perfection and had greater hopes from
the Indigo, if I could have the seed earlier, than
any of ye rest of ye things I had tried.</p>

<p>I have the burthen of 3 Plantations to transact
which requires much writing and more business
and fatigue of other sorts than you can
imagine. But lest you should imagine it too burthensome
to a girl in my early time of life, give
me leave to assure you I think myself happy that
I can be useful to so good a father.</p>

<p>Wont you laugh at me if I tell you I am so
busy in providing for Posterity I hardly allow
myself time to eat or sleep, and can but just
snatch a moment to write to you and a friend or
two more. I am making a large plantation of
oaks which I look upon as my own property
whether my father gives me the land or not,
and therefore I design many yeer hence when

A widow hereabouts with a pretty little fortune
teazed me intolerably to draw a marriage
settlement, but it was out of my depth and I absolutely
refused it—so she got an able hand to
do it—indeed she could afford it—but I could
not get off being one of the Trustees to her settlement,
and an old Gentⁿ the other. I shall begin
to think myself an old woman before I am a
young one, having such mighty affairs on my
hands.</p>
</div>

<p>I think this record of important work could
scarce be equalled by any young girl in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
comparative station of life nowadays. And
when we consider the trying circumstances,
the difficult conditions, in which these varied
enterprises were carried on, we can well be
amazed at the story.</p>

<p>Indigo was not the only important staple
which attracted Mrs. Pinckney’s attention,
and the manufacture of which she made a
success. In 1755 she carried with her to
England enough rich silk fabric, which she
had raised and spun and woven herself in
the vicinity of Charleston, to make three fine
silk gowns, one of which was presented to
the Princess Dowager of Wales, and another
to Lord Chesterfield. This silk was said to
be equal in beauty to any silk ever imported.</p>

<p>This was not the first American silk that
had graced the person of English royalty.
In 1734 the first windings of Georgia silk
had been taken from the filature to England,
and the queen wore a dress made thereof at
the king’s next birthday. Still earlier in the
field Virginia had sent its silken tribute to
royalty. In the college library at Williamsburg,
Va., may be seen a letter signed
“Charles R.”—his most Gracious Majesty
Charles the Second. It was written by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
Majesty’s private secretary, and addressed to
Governor Berkeley for the king’s loyal subjects
in Virginia. It reads thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Trusty and Well beloved, We Greet you Well.
Wee have received wᵗʰ much content ye dutifull
respects of Our Colony in ye present lately made
us by you &amp; ye councill there, of ye first product
of ye new Manufacture of Silke, which as a marke
of Our Princely acceptation of yoʳ duteys &amp; for
yoʳ particular encouragement, etc. Wee have been
commanded to be wrought up for ye use of Our

</div>

<p>And earliest of all is the tradition, dear to
the hearts of Virginians, that Charles I. was
crowned in 1625 in a robe woven of Virginia
silk. The Queen of George III. was the last
English royalty to be similarly honored, for
the next attack of the silk fever produced
a suit for an American ruler, George Washington.</p>

<p>The culture of silk in America was an industry
calculated to attract the attention of
women, and indeed was suited to them, but
men were not exempt from the fever; and
the history of the manifold and undaunted
efforts of governor’s councils, parliaments,
noblemen, philosophers, and kings to force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
silk culture in America forms one of the
most curious examples extant of persistent
and futile efforts to run counter to positive
economic conditions, for certainly physical
conditions are fairly favorable.</p>

<p>South Carolina women devoted themselves
with much success to agricultural experiments.
Henry Laurens brought from Italy
and naturalized the olive-tree, and his daughter,
Martha Laurens Ramsay, experimented
with the preservation of the fruit until her
productions equalled the imported olives.
Catharine Laurens Ramsay manufactured
opium of the first quality. In 1755 Henry
Laurens’ garden in Ansonborough was enriched
with every curious vegetable product
from remote quarters of the world that his
extensive mercantile connections enabled him
to procure, and the soil and climate of South
Carolina to cherish. He introduced besides
olives, capers, limes, ginger, guinea grass,
Alpine strawberries (bearing nine months in
the year), and many choice varieties of fruits.
This garden was superintended by his wife,
Mrs. Elinor Laurens.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martha Logan was a famous botanist
and florist. She was born in 1702, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
the daughter of Robert Daniel, one of the
last proprietary governors of South Carolina.
When fourteen years old, she married George
Logan, and all her life treasured a beautiful
and remarkable garden. When seventy years
old, she compiled from her knowledge and
experience a regular treatise on gardening,
which was published after her death, with
the title <i>The Garden’s Kalendar</i>. It was
for many years the standard work on gardening
in that locality.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopton and Mrs. Lamboll were early
and assiduous flower-raisers and experimenters
in the eighteenth century, and Miss
Maria Drayton, of Drayton Hall, a skilled
botanist.</p>

<p>The most distinguished female botanist of
colonial days was Jane Colden, the daughter
of Governor Cadwallader Colden, of New
York. Her love of the science was inherited
from her father, the friend and correspondent
of Linnæus, Collinson, and other botanists.
She learned a method of taking leaf-impressions
in printers’ ink, and sent careful impressions
of American plants and leaves to
the European collectors. John Ellis wrote
of her to Linnæus in April, 1758:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This young lady merits your esteem, and does
honor to your system. She has drawn and described
four hundred plants in your method. Her
father has a plant called after her Coldenia. Suppose
you should call this new genus Coldenella
or any other name which might distinguish her.</p>
</div>

<p>Peter Collinson said also that she was the
first lady to study the Linnæan system, and
deserved to be celebrated. Another tribute
to her may be found in a letter of Walter
Rutherford’s:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From the middle of the Woods this Family
corresponds with all the learned Societies in
Europe. His daughter Jenny is a Florist and
Botanist. She has discovered a great number of
Plants never before described and has given their
Properties and Virtues, many of which are found
useful in Medicine and she draws and colours
them with great Beauty. Dr. Whyte of Edinburgh
is in the number of her correspondents.</p>

<p>N. B. She makes the best cheese I ever ate

palliate and excuse so much
feminine scientific
knowledge.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br><span class="small">“DOUBLE-TONGUED AND NAUGHTY WOMEN.”</span></h2></div>


<p>I am much impressed in reading the court
records of those early days, to note the
vast care taken in all the colonies to prevent
lying, slandering, gossiping, backbiting, and
idle babbling, or, as they termed it, “brabling;”
to punish “common sowers and movers”—of
dissensions, I suppose.</p>

<p>The loving neighborliness which proved
as strong and as indispensable a foundation
for a successful colony as did godliness,
made the settlers resent deeply any violations,
though petty, of the laws of social
kindness. They felt that what they termed
“opprobrious schandalls tending to defamaçon
and disparagment” could not be endured.</p>

<p>One old author declares that “blabbing,
babbling, tale-telling, and discovering the
faults and frailities of others is a most Common
and evill practice.” He asserts that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
woman should be a “main store house of
secresie, a Maggazine of taciturnitie, the
closet of connivence, the mumbudget of silence,
the cloake bagge of rouncell, the capcase,
fardel, or pack of friendly toleration;”
which, as a whole, seems to be a good deal
to ask. Men were, as appears by the records,
more frequently brought up for these offences
of the tongue, but women were not spared
either in indictment or punishment. In
Windsor, Conn., one woman was whipped
for “wounding” a neighbor, not in the flesh,
but in the sensibilities.</p>

<p>In 1652 Joane Barnes, of Plymouth, Mass.,
was indicted for “slandering,” and sentenced
“to sitt in the stockes during the Courts
pleasure, and a paper whereon her facte written
in Capitall letters to be made faste vnto
her hatt or neare vnto her all the tyme of
her sitting there.” In 1654 another Joane
in Northampton County, Va., suffered a peculiarly
degrading punishment for slander.
She was “drawen ouer the Kings Creeke at
the starne of a boate or Canoux, also the
next Saboth day in the tyme of diuine seruis”
was obliged to present herself before
the minister and congregation, and acknowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
her fault, and ask forgiveness. This
was an old Scotch custom. The same year
one Charlton called the parson, Mr. Cotton,
a “black cotted rascal,” and was punished
therefor in the same way. Richard Buckland,
for writing a slanderous song about Ann
Smith, was similarly pilloried, bearing a paper
on his hat inscribed <i>Inimicus Libellus</i>, and
since possibly all the church attendants did
not know Latin, to publicly beg Ann’s forgiveness
in English for his libellous poesy.
The punishment of offenders by exposing
them, wrapped in sheets, or attired in foul
clothing, on the stool of repentance in the
meeting-house in time of divine service, has
always seemed to me specially bitter, unseemly,
and unbearable.</p>

<p>It should be noted that these suits for
slander were between persons in every station
of life. When Anneke Jans Bogardus
(wife of Dominie Bogardus, the second established
clergyman in New Netherlands), would
not remain in the house with one Grietje van
Salee, a woman of doubtful reputation, the
latter told throughout the neighborhood that
Anneke had lifted her petticoats when crossing
the street, and exposed her ankles in unseemly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
fashion; and she also said that the
Dominie had sworn a false oath. Action for
slander was promptly begun, and witnesses
produced to show that Anneke had flourished
her petticoats no more than was seemly
and tidy to escape the mud. Judgment was
pronounced against Grietje and her husband.
She had to make public declaration
in the Fort that she had lied, and to pay
three guilders. The husband had to pay
a fine, and swear to the good character of
the Dominie and good carriage of the Dominie’s
wife, and he was not permitted to
carry weapons in town,—a galling punishment.</p>

<p>Dominie Bogardus was in turn sued several
times for slander,—once by Thomas
Hall, the tobacco planter, simply for saying
that Thomas’ tobacco was bad; and again,
wonderful to relate, by one of his deacons—Deacon
Van Cortlandt.</p>

<p>Special punishment was provided for
women. Old Dr. Johnson said gruffly to a
lady friend: “Madam, there are different
ways of restraining evil; stocks for men, a
ducking-stool for women, pounds for beasts.”
The old English instrument of punishment,—as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
old as the Doomsday survey,—the
cucking-stool or ducking-stool, was in vogue
here, was insultingly termed a “publique
convenience,” and was used in the Southern
and Central colonies for the correction of
common scolds. We read in Blackstone’s
<i>Commentaries</i>, “A common scold may be
indicted and if convicted shall be sentenced
to be placed in a certain engine of correction
called the trebucket, castigatory, or cucking-stool.”
Still another name for this “engine”
was a “gum-stool.” The brank, or scold’s
bridle,—a cruel and degrading means of
punishment employed in England for “curst
queans” as lately as 1824,—was unknown
in America. A brank may be seen at the
Guildhall in Worcester, England. One at
Walton-on-Thames bears the date 1633. On
the Isle of Man, when the brank was removed,
the wearer had to say thrice, in public,
“Tongue, thou hast lied.” I do not find
that women ever had to “run the gauntelope”
as did male offenders in 1685 in Boston,
and, though under another name, in
several of the provinces.</p>

<p>Women in Maine were punished by being
gagged; in Plymouth, Mass., and in Easthampton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
L. I., they had cleft sticks placed
on their tongues in public; in the latter
place because the dame said her husband
“had brought her to a place where there was
neither gospel nor magistracy.” In Salem
“one Oliver—his wife” had a cleft stick
placed on her tongue for half an hour in public
“for reproaching the elders.” It was a
high offence to speak “discornfully” of the
elders and magistrates.</p>

<p>The first volume of the <i>American Historical
Record</i> gives a letter said to have been
written to Governor Endicott, of Massachusetts,
in 1634 by one Thomas Hartley
from Hungar’s Parish, Virginia. It gives a
graphic description of a ducking-stool, and an
account of a ducking in Virginia. I quote
from it:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The day afore yesterday at two of ye clock in
ye afternoon I saw this punishment given to one
Betsey wife of John Tucker, who by ye violence
of her tongue had made his house and ye neighborhood
uncomfortable. She was taken to ye
pond where I am sojourning by ye officer who
was joyned by ye magistrate and ye Minister Mr.
Cotton, who had frequently admonished her and a
large number of People. They had a machine for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
ye purpose yᵗ belongs to ye Parish, and which I
was so told had been so used three times this
Summer. It is a platform with 4 small rollers or
wheels and two upright posts between which
works a Lever by a Rope fastened to its shorter
or heavier end. At the end of ye longer arm is
fixed a stool upon which sᵈ Betsey was fastened
by cords, her gown tied fast around her feete.
The Machine was then moved up to ye edge of
ye pond, ye Rope was slackened by ye officer and
ye woman was allowed to go down under ye water
for ye space of half a minute. Betsey had a stout
stomach, and would not yield until she had
allowed herself to be ducked 5 severall times.
At length she cried piteously Let me go Let me
go, by Gods help I’ll sin no more. Then they
drew back ye machine, untied ye Ropes and let
her walk home in her wetted clothes a hopefully
penitent woman.</p>
</div>

<p>I have seen an old chap-book print of a
ducking-stool with a “light huswife of the
banck-side” in it. It was rigged much like
an old-fashioned well-sweep, the woman and
chair occupying the relative place of the
bucket. The base of the upright support
was on a low-wheeled platform.</p>

<p>Bishop Meade, in his <i>Old Churches, Ministers,
and Families of Virginia</i>, tells of one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
“scolding quean” who was ordered to be
ducked three times from a vessel lying in
James River. Places for ducking were prepared
near the Court Houses. The marshal’s
fee for ducking was only two pounds of tobacco.
The ducking-stools were not kept in
church porches, as in England. In 1634 two
women were sentenced to be either drawn
from King’s Creek “from one Cowpen to another
at the starn of a boat or kanew,” or to
present themselves before the congregation,
and ask forgiveness of each other and God.
In 1633 it was ordered that a ducking-stool
be built in every county in Maryland. At a
court-baron at St. Clements, the county was
prosecuted for not having one of these “public
conveniences.” In February, 1775, a
ducking-stool was ordered to be placed at the
confluence of the Ohio and Monongahela
Rivers, and was doubtless used. As late as
1819 Georgia women were ducked in the
Oconee River for scolding. And in 1824, at
the court of Quarter Sessions, a Philadelphia
woman was sentenced to be ducked, but the
punishment was not inflicted, as it was
deemed obsolete and contrary to the spirit
of the times. In 1803 the ducking-stool was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
still used in Liverpool, England, and in 1809
in Leominster, England.</p>

<p>One of the last indictments for ducking
in our own country was that of Mrs. Anne
Royall in Washington, almost in our own
day. She was a hated lobbyist, whom Mr.
Forney called an itinerant virago, and who
became so abusive to congressmen that she
was indicted as a common scold before Judge
William Cranch, and was sentenced by him
to be ducked in the Potomac. She was,
however, released with a fine.</p>

<p>Women curst with a shrewish tongue were
often punished in Puritan colonies. In 1647
it was ordered that “common scoulds” be
punished in Rhode Island by ducking, but
I find no records of the punishment being
given. In 1649 several women were prosecuted
in Salem, Mass., for scolding; and
on May 15, 1672, the General Court of Massachusetts
ordered that scolds and railers
should be gagged or “set in a ducking-stool
and dipped over head and ears three times,”
but I do not believe that this law was ever
executed in Massachusetts. Nor was it in
Maine, though in 1664 a dozen towns were
fined forty shillings each for having no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
“coucking-stool.” Equally severe punishments
were inflicted for other crimes. Katharine
Ainis, of Plymouth, was publicly
whipped on training day, and ordered to
wear a large B cut in red cloth “sewed to
her vper garment.” In 1637 Dorothy Talbye,
a Salem dame, for beating her husband was
ordered to be bound and chained to a post.
At a later date she was whipped, and then
was hanged for killing her child, who bore
the strange name of Difficulty. No one but
a Puritan magistrate could doubt, from Winthrop’s
account of her, that she was insane.
Another “audatious” Plymouth shrew, for
various “vncivill carriages” to her husband,
was sentenced to the pillory; and if half that
was told of her was true, she richly deserved
her sentence; but, as she displayed “greate
pensiveness and sorrow” before the simple
Pilgrim magistrates, she escaped temporarily,
to be punished at a later date for a greater
sin. The magistrates firmly asserted in
court and out that “meekness is ye chojsest
orniment for a woman.”</p>

<p>Joane Andrews sold in York, Maine, in
1676, two stones in a firkin of butter. For
this cheatery she “stood in towne meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
at York and at towne meeting at Kittery
till 2 hours bee expended, with her offense
written upon a paper in capitall letters on
her forehead.” The court record of one
woman delinquent in Plymouth, in 1683, is
grimly comic. It seems that Mary Rosse
exercised what was called by the “painful”
court chronicler in a triumph of orthographical
and nomenclatory art, an “inthewsiastickall
power” over one Shingleterry, a married
man, who cringingly pleaded, as did our
first father Adam, that “hee must doo what
shee bade him”—or, in modern phrase, that
she hypnotized him. Mary Rosse and her
uncanny power did not receive the consideration
that similar witches and works do nowadays.
She was publicly whipped and sent
home to her mother, while her hypnotic subject
was also whipped, and I presume sent
home to his wife.</p>

<p>It should be noted that in Virginia, under
the laws proclaimed by Argall, women were
in some ways tenderly regarded. They were
not punished for absenting themselves from
church on Sundays or holidays; while men
for one offence of this nature had “to lie
neck and heels that night, and be a slave to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
the colony for the following week; for the
second offence to be a slave for a month; for
the third, for a year and a day.”</p>

<p>It is curious to see how long and how constantly,
in spite of their severe and manifold
laws, the pious settlers could suffer through
certain ill company which they had been unlucky
enough to bring over, provided the
said offenders did not violate the religious
rules of the community. We might note as
ignoble instances, Will Fancie and his wife,
of New Haven, and John Dandy and his
wife, of Maryland. Their names constantly
appear for years in the court records, as
offenders and as the cause of offences. John
Dandy at one time swore in court that all
his “controversies from the beginning of
the World to this day” had ceased; but it
would have been more to the purpose had he
also added till the end of the world, for his
violence soon brought him to the gallows.
Will Fancie’s wife seemed capable of any
and every offence, from “stealing pinnes”
to stealing the affections of nearly every man
with whom she chanced to be thrown; and
the magistrates of New Haven were evidently
sorely puzzled how to deal with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>I have noted in the court or church records
of all witch-ridden communities, save in
the records of poor crazed and bewildered
Salem, where the flame was blown into a
roaring blaze by “the foolish breath of Cotton
Mather,” that there always appear on the
pages some plain hints, and usually some
definite statements, which account for the
accusation of witchcraft against individuals.
And these hints indicate a hated personality
of the witch. To illustrate my meaning, let
me take the case of Goody Garlick, of
Easthampton, Long Island. In reading the
early court records of that town, I was impressed
with the constant meddlesome interference
of this woman in all social and town
matters. Every page reeked of Garlick. She
was an ever-ready witness in trespass, boundary,
and slander suits, for she was apparently
on hand everywhere. She was present when
a young man made ugly faces at the wife of
Lion Gardiner, because she scolded him for
eating up her “pomkin porage;” and she
was listening when Mistress Edwards was
called a base liar, because she asserted she
had in her chest a new petticoat that she had
brought from England some years before, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
had never worn (and of course no woman
could believe that). In short, Goody Garlick
was a constant tale-bearer and barrator.
Hence it was not surprising to me to find,
when Mistress Arthur Howell, Lion Gardiner’s
daughter, fell suddenly and strangely
ill, and cried out that “a double-tongued
naughty woman was tormenting her, a woman
who had a black cat,” that the wise neighbors
at once remembered that Goody Garlick was
double-tongued and naughty, and had a black
cat. She was speedily indicted for witchcraft,
and the gravamen appeared to be her
constant tale-bearing.</p>

<p>In 1706 a Virginian goody with a prettier
name, Grace Sherwood, was tried as a witch;
and with all the superstition of the day, and
the added superstition of the surrounding
and rapidly increasing negro population, there
were but three Virginian witch-trials. Grace
Sherwood’s name was also of constant recurrence
in court annals, from the year 1690, on
the court records of Princess Anne County,
especially in slander cases. She was examined,
after her indictment, for “witches
marks” by a jury of twelve matrons, each
of whom testified that Grace was “not like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
yur.” The magistrates seem to have been
somewhat disconcerted at the convicting
testimony of this jury, and at a loss how to
proceed, but the witch asserted her willingness
to endure trial by water. A day was
set for the ducking, but it rained, and
the tenderly considerate court thought the
weather unfavorable for the trial on account
of the danger to Grace’s health, and postponed
the ducking. At last, on a sunny
July day, when she could not take cold, the
witch was securely pinioned and thrown into
Lyn Haven Bay, with directions from the
magistrates to “but her into the debth.”
Into the “debth” of the water she should
have contentedly and innocently sunk, but
“contrary to the Judgments of all the spectators”
she persisted in swimming, and at
last was fished out and again examined to see
whether the “witches marks” were washed
off. One of the examiners was certainly far
from being prepossessed in Grace’s favor.
She was a dame who eight years before had
testified that “Grace came to her one night,
and rid her, and went out of the key hole or
crack in the door like a black cat.” Grace
Sherwood was not executed, and she did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
die of the ducking, but it cooled her quarrelsome
temper. She lived till 1740. The
point where she was butted into the depth is
to this day called Witches Duck.</p>

<p>Grace Sherwood was not the only poor
soul that passed through the “water-test”
or “the fleeting on the water” for witchcraft.
In September, 1692, in Fairfield,
Conn., the accused witches “Mercy Disburrow
and Elizabeth Clauson were bound hand
and foot and put into the water, and they
swam like cork, and one labored to press
them into the water, and they buoyed up
like cork.” Many cruel scenes were enacted
in Connecticut, none more so than the persistent
inquisition of Goodwife Knapp after
she was condemned to death for witchcraft.
She was constantly tormented by her old
friends and neighbors to confess and to
accuse one Goody Staples as an accomplice;
but the poor woman repeated that she must
not wrong any one nor say anything untrue.
She added:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The truth is you would have me say that goodwife
Staples is a witch but I have sins enough to
answer for already, I know nothing against goodwife
Staples and I hope she is an honest woman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
You know not what I know. I have been fished
withall in private more than you are aware of. I
apprehend that goodwife Staples hath done me
wrong in her testimony but I must not return
evil for evil.</p>
</div>

<p>Being still urged and threatened with eternal
damnation, she finally burst into bitter
tears, and begged her persecutors to cease,
saying in words that must have lingered long
in their memory, and that still make the
heart ache, “Never, never was poor creature
tempted as I am tempted! oh pray! pray for
me!”</p>

<p>The last scene in this New England
tragedy was when her poor dead body was
cut down from the gallows, and laid upon the
green turf beside her grave; and her old
neighbors, excited with superstition, and
blinded to all sense of shame or unwomanliness,
crowded about examining eagerly for
“witch signs;” while in the foreground
Goodwife Staples, whose lying words had
hanged her friend, kneeled by the poor insulted
corpse, weeping and wringing her
hands, calling upon God, and asserting the
innocence of the murdered woman.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that, in an era which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
did not much encourage the public speech
or public appearance of women, they should
have served on juries; yet they occasionally
did, not only in witchcraft cases such as
Grace Sherwood’s and Alice Cartwright’s,—another
Virginia witch,—but in murder
cases, as in Kent County, Maryland; these
juries were not usually to render the final
decision, but to decide upon certain points,
generally purely personal, by which their
wise husbands could afterwards be guided.
I don’t know that these female juries shine
as exemplars of wisdom and judgment. In
1693 a jury of twelve women in Newbury,
Mass., rendered this decision, which certainly
must have been final:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Wee judge according to our best lights and
contients that the Death of said Elizabeth was
not by any violens or wrong done to her by any
parson or thing but by some soden stoping of hir
Breath.</p>
</div>

<p>In Revolutionary days a jury of “twelve
discreet matrons” of Worcester, Mass., gave
a decision in the case of Bathsheba Spooner,
which was found after her execution to be a
wrong judgment. She was the last woman
hanged by law in Massachusetts, and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
cruel fate may have proved a vicarious suffering
and means of exemption for other
women criminals.</p>

<p>Women, as well as men, when suspected
murderers, had to go through the cruel and
shocking “blood-ordeal.” This belief, supported
by the assertions of that learned fool,
King James, in his <i>Demonologie</i>, lingered
long in the minds of many,—indeed does
to this day in poor superstitious folk. The
royal author says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In a secret murther, if the dead carkas be at
any time thereafter handled by the murtherer, it
will gush out of blood.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes a great number of persons were
made to touch in turn the dead body, hoping
thus to discover the murderer.</p>

<p>It has been said that few women were
taught to write in colonial days, and that
those few wrote so ill their letters could
scarce be read. I have seen a goodly number
of letters written by women in those
times, and the handwriting is comparatively
as good as that of their husbands and brothers.
Margaret Winthrop wrote with precision
and elegance. A letter of Anne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
Winthrop’s dated 1737 is clear, regular, and
beautiful. Mary Higginson’s writing is fair,
and Elizabeth Cushing’s irregular and uncertain,
as if of infrequent occurrence. Elizabeth
Corwin’s is clear, though irregular;
Mehitable Parkman’s more careless and
wavering; all are easily read. But the most
beautiful old writing I have ever seen,—elegant,
regular, wonderfully clear and well-proportioned,
was written by the hand of
a woman,—a criminal, a condemned murderer,
Elizabeth Attwood, who was executed
in 1720 for the murder of her infant child.
The letter was written from “Ipswitch Gole
in Bonds” to Cotton Mather, and is a most
pathetic and intelligent appeal for his interference
to save her life. The beauty and
simplicity of her language, the force and
directness of her expressions, her firm denial
of the crime, her calm religious assurance,
are most touching to read, even after the
lapse of centuries, and make one wonder that
any one—magistrate or priest,—even Cotton
Mather—could doubt her innocence.
But she was hanged before a vast concourse
of eager people, and was declared most impenitent
and bold in her denial of her guilt;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
and it was brought up against her, as a most
hardened brazenry, that to cheat the hangman
(who always took as handsel of his victim
the garments in which she was “turned
off”), she appeared in her worst attire, and
announced that he would get but a sorry
suit from her. I do not know the
estate in life of Elizabeth Attwood,
but it could not have
been mean, for her letter
shows great
refinement.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br><span class="small">BOSTON NEIGHBORS.</span></h2></div>


<p>Accounts of isolated figures are often
more interesting than chapters of general
history, and biographies more attractive
than state records, because more petty details
of vivid human interest can be learned; so,
in order to present clearly a picture of the
social life of women in the earliest days of
New England, I give a description of a group
of women, contiguous in residence, and contemporary
in life, rather than an account of
some special dame of dignity or note; and I
call this group Boston Neighbors.</p>

<p>If the setting of this picture would add to
its interest, it is easy to portray the little
settlement. The peninsula, but half as large
as the Boston of to-day, was fringed with sea-marshes,
and was crowned with three conical
hills, surmounted respectively with the windmill,
the fort, and the beacon. The champaign
was simply an extended pasture with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
few trees, but fine springs of water. Winding
footpaths—most interesting of roadways—connected
the detached dwellings, and
their irregular outlines still show in our Boston
streets. The thatched clay houses were
being replaced by better and more substantial
dwellings. William Coddington had built
the first brick house.</p>

<p>On the main street, now Washington
Street, just east of where the Old South
Church now stands, lived the dame of highest
degree, and perhaps the most beautiful
personality, in this little group—Margaret
Tyndal Winthrop, the “loving faythfull yoke-fellow”
of Governor John Winthrop. She
was his third wife, though he was but thirty
when he married her. He had been first
married when but seventeen years old. He
writes that he was conceived by his parents
to be at that age a man in stature and understanding.
This wife brought to him, and left
to him, “a large portion of outward estate,”
and four little children. Of the second wife
he writes, “For her carriage towards myselfe,
it was so amiable and observant as I am not
able to expresse; it had only this inconvenience,
that it made me delight in hir too much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
to enjoy hir long,”—and she lived with him
but a year and a day. He married Margaret
in 1618, and when she had borne five children,
he left her in 1630, and sailed to New
England. She came also the following year,
and was received “with great joy” and a
day of Thanksgiving. For the remaining
sixteen years of her life she had but brief
separations from her husband, and she died,
as he wrote, “especially beloved of all the
country.” Her gentle love-letters to her
husband, and the simple testimony of contemporary
letters of her relatives and friends,
show her to have been truly “a sweet gracious
woman” who endured the hardships of
her new home, the Governor’s loss of fortune,
and his trying political experiences, with
unvarying patience and “singular virtue,
modesty and piety.”</p>

<p>There lived at this time in Boston a woman
who must have been well known personally
by Madam Winthrop, for she was a near
neighbor, living within stone’s throw of the
Governor’s house, on the spot where now
stands “The Old Corner Bookstore.” This
woman was Anne Hutchinson. She came
with Rev. John Cotton from Boston, England,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
to Boston, New England, well respected
and well beloved. She went an outcast,
hated and feared by many she left behind
her in Boston. For years her name was on
every tongue, while she was under repeated
trials and examinations for heresy. In the
controversy over her and her doctrines, magistrates,
ministers, women, soldiers, the common
multitude of Boston, all took part, and
took sides; through the pursuance of the
controversy the government of the colony
was changed. Her special offences against
doctrines were those two antiquated “heresies,”
Antinomianism and Familism, which I
could hardly define if I would. According
to Winthrop they were “those two dangerous
errors that the person of the Holy Ghost
dwells in a justified person, and that no
sanctification can help to evidence to us our
justification.” Her special offences against
social and religious routines were thus related
by Cotton Mather:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At the meetings of the women which used to
be called gossippings it was her manner to carry
on very pious discourses and so put the neighborhood
upon examining their spiritual estates by
telling them how far a person might go in “trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
of mind,” and being restrained from very
many evils and constrained into very many duties,
by none but a legal work upon their souls without
ever coming to a saving union with the Lord
Jesus Christ, that many of them were convinced
of a very great defect in the settlement of their
everlasting peace, and acquainted more with the
“Spirit of the Gospel” than ever they were
before. This mighty show and noise of devotion
made the reputation of a non-such among the
people until at length under pretence of that
warrant “that the elder women are to teach the
younger” she set up weekly meetings at her
house whereto three score or four score people
would report....</p>

<p>It was not long before it was found out that
most of the errors then crawling like vipers were
hatch’d at these meetings.</p>
</div>

<p>So disturbed was the synod of ministers
which was held early in the controversy, that
this question was at once resolved:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That though women might meet (some few together)
to pray and edify one another, yet such a
set assembly (as was then the practice in Boston)
where sixty or more did meet every week, and
one woman (in a prophetical way by resolving
questions of doctrines and expounding scripture)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
took upon her the whole exercise, was agreed to
be disorderly and without rule.</p>
</div>

<p>As I read the meagre evidences of her
belief, I see that Anne Hutchinson had a
high supernatural faith which, though mystical
at its roots, aimed at being practical in
its fruits; but she was critical, tactless, and
over-inquisitive, and doubtless censorious,
and worst of all she “vented her revelations,”
which made her seem to many of the
Puritans the very essence of fanaticism; so
she was promptly placed on trial for heresy
for “twenty-nine cursed opinions and falling
into fearful lying, with an impudent Forehead
in the public assembly.” The end of it all
in that theocracy could not be uncertain.
One woman, even though her followers included
Governor Sir Henry Vane, and a
hundred of the most influential men of the
community, could not stop the powerful machinery
of the Puritan Church and Commonwealth,
the calm, well-planned opposition of
Winthrop; and after a succession of mortifying
indignities, and unlimited petty hectoring
and annoying, she was banished. “The court
put an end to her vapouring talk, and finding
no hope of reclaiming her from her scandalous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
dangerous, and enchanting extravagancies,
ordered her out of the colony.”</p>

<p>In reading of her life, her trials, it is difficult
to judge whether—to borrow Howel’s
expression—the crosier or the distaff were
most to blame in all this sad business;
the preachers certainly took an over-active
part.</p>

<p>Of the personal appearance of this “erroneous
gentlewoman” we know nothing. I
do not think, in spite of the presumptive evidence
of the marked personal beauty of her
descendants, that she was a handsome woman,
else it would certainly be so stated. The
author of the <i>Short Story of the Rise Reigne
and Ruine of the Antinomians, Familists, and
Libertines that infected the Churches of New
England</i> calls her “a woman of a haughty
and fierce carriage, of a nimble wit and active
spirit, and a very voluble tongue, more bold
than a man, though in understanding and
judgment inferior to many women.” He
also termed her “the American Jezebel,”
and so did the traveller Josselyn in his <i>Account
of Two Voyages to New England</i>;
while Minister Hooker styled her “a
wretched woman.” Johnson, in his <i>Wonder-Working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
Providence</i>, calls her the “masterpiece
of woman’s wit.” Governor Winthrop
said she was “a woman of ready wit and bold
spirit.” Cotton Mather called her a virago,
cunning, canting, and proud, but he did not
know her.</p>

<p>We to-day can scarcely comprehend what
these “double weekly lectures” must have
been to these Boston women, with their extreme
conscientiousness, their sombre religious
belief, and their timid superstition, in
their hard and perhaps homesick life. The
materials for mental occupation and excitement
were meagre; hence the spiritual
excitement caused by Anne Hutchinson’s
prophesyings must have been to them a fascinating
religious dissipation. Many were
exalted with a supreme assurance of their
salvation. Others, bewildered with spiritual
doubts, fell into deep gloom and depression;
and one woman in utter desperation attempted
to commit a crime, and found
therein a natural source of relief, saying
“now she was sure she should be damned.”
Into all this doubt and depression the wives—to
use Cotton Mather’s phrase—“hooked
in their husbands.” So; perhaps, after all it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
was well to banish the fomenter of all these
troubles and bewilderments.</p>

<p>Still, I wonder whether Anne Hutchinson’s
old neighbors and gossips did not
regret these interesting meetings, these exciting
prophesyings, when they were sternly
ended. I hope they grieved for her when
they heard of her cruel death by Indian massacre;
and I know they remembered her unstinted,
kindly offices in time of sickness and
affliction; and I trust they honored “her
ever sober and profitable carriage,” and I
suspect some of them in their inmost hearts
deplored the Protestant Inquisition of their
fathers and husbands, that caused her exile
and consequent murder by the savages.</p>

<p>Samuel Johnson says, “As the faculty of
writing is chiefly a masculine endowment,
the reproach of making the world miserable
has always been thrown upon women.” As
the faculty of literary composition at that
day was wholly a masculine endowment, we
shall never know what the Puritan women
really thought of Anne Hutchinson, and
whether they threw upon her any reproach.</p>

<p>We gain a slight knowledge of what Margaret
Winthrop thought of all this religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
ecstasy, this bitter quarrelling, from a letter
written by her, and dated “Sad-Boston.”
She says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sad thoughts possess my sperits, and I cannot
repulce them; wch makes me unfit for anythinge,
wondringe what the Lord meanes by all these
troubles among us. Shure I am that all shall
worke to the best to them that love God, or rather
are loved of hime, I know he will bring light out
of obcurity and make his rituusnesse shine forth
as clere as the nounday; yet I find in myself
an aferce spiret, and a tremblinge hart, not so
willing to submit to the will of God as I desyre.
There is a time to plant, and a time to pull up
that which is planted, which I could desyre might
not be yet.</p>
</div>

<p>And so it would seem to us to-day that it
was indeed a doubtful beginning to tear up
with such violence even flaunting weeds, lest
the tender and scattered grain, whose roots
scarce held in the unfamiliar soil, might also
be uprooted and wither and die. But the
colony endured these trials, and flourished,
as it did other trials, and still prospered.</p>

<p>Though written expression of their feelings
is lacking, we know that the Boston
neighbors gave to Anne Hutchinson that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
sincerest flattery—imitation. Perhaps her
fellow-prophets should not be called imitators,
but simply kindred religious spirits.
The elements of society in colonial Boston
were such as plentifully to produce and stimulate
“disordered and heady persons.”</p>

<p>Among them was Mary Dyer, thus described
by Winthrop:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The wife of William Dyer, a milliner in the
New Exchange, a very proper and fair woman,
notoriously infected with Mrs Hutchinsons errors,
and very censorious and troublesome. She
being of a very proud spirit and much addicted
to revelations.</p>
</div>

<p>Another author called her “a comely
grave woman, of a goodly personage, and of
good report.”</p>

<p>Some of these Boston neighbors lived to
see two sad sights. Fair comely Mary Dyer,
after a decade of unmolested and peaceful
revelations in Rhode Island, returned to her
early home, and persistently preached to her
old friends, and then walked through Boston
streets hand in hand with two young Quaker
friends, condemned felons, to the sound of
the drums of the train band, glorying in her
companionship; and then she was set on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
gallows with a halter round her neck, while
her two friends were hanged before her
eyes; this was witnessed by such a multitude
that the drawbridge broke under the
weight of the returning North-enders. And
six months later this very proper and fair
woman herself was hanged in Boston, to rid
the commonwealth of an intolerable plague.</p>

<p>A letter still exists, written by William
Dyer to the Boston magistrates to “beg
affectionately the life of my deare wife.” It
is most touching, most heart-rending; it
ends thus, “Yourselves have been husbands
of wife or wives, and so am I, yea to one
most dearlye beloved. Oh do not you deprive
me of her, but I pray you give me her
out againe. Pitye me—I beg it with teares.”</p>

<p>The tears still stain this poor sorrowful,
appealing letter,—a missive so gentle, so
timid, so full of affection, of grief, that I
cannot now read it unmoved and I do indeed
“pitye” thee. William Dyer’s tears have
not been the only ones to fall on his beautiful,
tender words.</p>

<p>Another interesting neighbor living where
Washington Street crossed Brattle Street was
the bride, young Madam Bellingham, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
marriage had caused such a scandal in good
society in Boston. Winthrop’s account of
this affair is the best that could be given:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The governour Mr Bellingham was married.
The young gentlewoman was ready to be contracted
to a friend of his who lodged in his
house, and by his consent had proceeded so far
with her, when on a sudden the governour treated
with her, and obtained her for himself. He
excused it by the strength of his affection, and
that she was not absolutely promised to the
other gentleman. Two errors more he committed
upon it. 1. That he would not have his
contract published where he dwelt, contrary to
the order of court. 2. That he married himself
contrary to the constant practice of the country.
The great inquest prosecuted him for breach of
the order of the court, and at the court following
in the fourth month, the secretary called him to
answer the prosecution. But he not going off
the bench, as the manner was, and but few of the
magistrates present, he put it off to another time,
intending to speak with him privately, and with
the rest of the magistrates about the case, and
accordingly he told him the reason why he did
not proceed, viz., that being unwilling to command
him publicly to go off the bench, and yet
not thinking it fit he should sit as a judge, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
he was by law to answer as an offender. This
he took ill, and said he would not go off the
bench except he were commanded.</p>
</div>

<p>I think the young English girl, Penelope
Pelham, must have been sadly bewildered
by the strange abrupt ways of the new land,
by her dictatorial elderly lover, by his autocratic
and singular marriage with her, by
the attempted action of the government
against him. She had a long life thereafter,
for he lived to be eighty years old, and she
survived him thirty years.</p>

<p>A very querulous and turbulent neighbor
who lived on Milk Street was Mistress Ann
Hibbins, the wife of one of Boston’s honored
citizens. Her husband had been unsuccessful
in business matters, and this “so discomposed
his wife’s spirit that she was
scarce ever well settled in her mind afterwards,”
and at last was put out of the church
and by her strange carriage gave occasion
to her superstitious neighbors to charge her
with being a witch. She was brought to
trial for witchcraft, convicted, sentenced,
and hung upon a Thursday lecture day, in
spite of her social position, and the fact that
her brother was Governor Bellingham. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
had other friends, high in authority, as her
will shows, and she had the belongings of a
colonial dame, “a diamond ring, a taffety
cloke, silk gown and kirtle, pinck-colored petticoat,
and money in the deske.” Minister
Beach wrote to Increase Mather in 1684:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have sometimes told you your famous Mr
Norton once said at his own table before Mr
Wilson, Elder Penn and myself and wife who
had the honour to be his guests—that the wife
of one of your magistrates, I remember, was
hanged for a witch only for having more wit
than her neighbors. It was his very expression;
she having as he explained it, unhappily guessed
that two of her prosecutors, whom she saw talking
in the street were talking about her—which
cost her her life, notwithstanding all he could do
to the contrary.</p>
</div>

<p>It would naturally be thought, from the
affectionate and intense devotion of the
colonists to the school which had just become
“Harvard-Colledge,” that Mr. Nathaniel
Eaton, the head-master of the freshly
established seat of learning, would be a citizen
of much esteem, and his wife a dame of
as dignified carriage and honored station as
any of her Boston and Cambridge neighbors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
Let us see whether such was the case. Mr.
Eaton had had much encouragement to continue
at the head of the college for life; he
had been offered a tract of five hundred
acres of land, and liberal support had been
offered by the government, and he “had
many scholars, the sons of gentlemen and
of others of best note in the country.” Yet
when he fell out with one of his ushers on
very slight occasion, he struck the usher
and caused two more to hold the poor fellow
while he beat him two hundred stripes with
a heavy walnut cudgel; and when poor Usher
Briscoe fell a-praying, in fear of dying, Master
Eaton beat him further for taking the
name of God in vain. When all this cruelty
was laid to him in open court “his answers
were full of pride and disdain,” and he said
he had this unvarying rule, “that he would
not give over correcting till he had subdued
the party to his will.” And upon being
questioned about other malpractices, especially
the ill and scant diet provided by him
for the students, though good board had
been paid by them, he, Adam-like, “put it
off to his wife.”</p>

<p>Her confession of her connection with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
matter is still in existence, and proves her
accomplishments as a generous and tidy
housewife about equal to his dignity and
lenity as head of the college. It is a most
curious and minute document, showing
what her duties were, and the way she performed
them, and also giving an interesting
glimpse of college life in those days. It
reads thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For their breakfast that it was not so well
ordered, the flower not so fine as it might, nor so
well boiled or stirred at all times that it was so,
it was my sin of neglect, and want of care that
ought to have been in one that the Lord had intrusted
with such a work.</p>

<p>Concerning their beef, that was allowed them,
as they affirm, which I confess had been my duty
to have seen they should have had it, and continued
to have had it, because it was my husbands
command; but truly I must confess, to my
shame, I cannot remember that ever they had it
nor that ever it was taken from them.</p>

<p>And that they had not so good or so much
provision in my husbands absence as presence, I
conceive it was, because he would call sometimes
for butter or cheese when I conceived there was
no need of it; yet for as much as the scholars
did otherways apprehend, I desire to see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
evil that was in the carriage of that as in the
other and to take shame to myself for it.</p>

<p>And that they sent down for more, when they
had not enough, and the maid should answer, if
they had not, they should not. I must confess
that I have denied them cheese, when they have
sent for it, and it have been in the house, for
which I shall humbly beg pardon to them, and
own the shame, and confess my sin.</p>

<p>And for such provoking words which my servants
have given, I cannot own them, but am
sorry any such should be given in my house.</p>

<p>And for bad fish, they had it brought to table,
I am sorry there was that cause of offence given;
I acknowledge my sin in it.... I am much
ashamed it should be in the family, and not prevented
by myself or my servants, and I humbly
acknowledge my negligence in it.</p>

<p>And that they made their beds at any time,
were my straits never so great, I am sorry they
were ever put to it.</p>

<p>For the Moor, his lying in Sam Hough’s sheet
and pillow-bier, it hath a truth in it; he did so
at one time and it gave Sam Hough just cause
for offence; and that it was not prevented by my
care and watchfulness I desire to take the shame
and the sorrow for it.</p>

<p>And that they eat the Moor’s crusts, and the
swine and they had share and share alike; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
the Moor to have beer, and they denied it, and if
they had not enough, for my maid to answer they
should not, I am an utter stranger to these things,
and know not the least foot-steps for them so to
charge me; and if my servants were guilty of
such miscarriages, had the boarders complained
of it unto myself, I should have thought it my
sin, if I had not sharply removed my servants
and endeavored reform.</p>

<p>And for bread made of sour heated meal,
though I know of but once that it was so since I
kept house, yet John Wilson affirms that it was
twice; and I am truly sorry that any of it was
spent amongst them.</p>

<p>For beer and bread that it was denied them by
me betwixt meals, truly I do not remember, that
ever I did deny it unto them; and John Wilson
will affirm that, generally, the bread and beer
was free for the boarders to go to.</p>

<p>And that money was demanded of them for
washing the linen, tis true that it was propounded
to them but never imposed upon them.</p>

<p>And for their pudding being given the last
day of the week without butter or suet, and
that I said, it was a miln of Manchester in old
England, its true that I did say so, and am sorry,
that had any cause of offence given them by
having it so.</p>

<p>And for their wanting beer betwixt brewings, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
week or half a week together, I am sorry that it
was so at any time, and should tremble to have
it so, were it in my hands to do again.</p>

<p>And whereas they say, that sometimes they
have sent down for more meat and it hath been
denied, when it have been in the house, I must
confess, to my shame, that I have denied them
oft, when they have sent for it, and it have been
in the house.</p>
</div>

<p>Truly a pitiful tale of shiftless stinginess,
of attempted extortion, of ill-regulated service,
and of overworked housewifery as well.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Eaton did not escape
punishment for his sins. After much obstinacy
he “made a very solid, wise, eloquent,
and serious confession, condemning himself
in all particulars.” The court, with Winthrop
at the head, bore lightly upon him after
this confession, and yet when sentence of banishment
from the college, and restriction from
teaching within the jurisdiction, was passed,
and he was fined £30, he did not give glory
to God as was expected, but turned away
with a discontented look. Then the church
took the matter up to discipline him, and the
schoolmaster promptly ran away, leaving
debts of a thousand pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>The last scene in the life of Mrs. Eaton
may be given in Winthrop’s words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Nathaniel Eaton being come to Virginia,
took upon him to be a minister there, but was
given up to extreme pride and sensuality, being
usually drunken, as the custom is there. He sent
for his wife and children. Her friends here persuaded
her to stay awhile, but she went, notwithstanding,
and the vessel was never heard of
after.</p>
</div>

<p>So you see she had friends and neighbors
who wished her to remain in New England
with them, and who may have loved her in
spite of the sour bread, and scant beer, and
bad fish, that she doled out to the college
students.</p>

<p>There was one visitor who flashed upon
this chill New England scene like a brilliant
tropical bird; with all the subtle fascination
of a foreigner; speaking a strange language;
believing a wicked Popish faith; and englamoured
with the romance of past adventure,
with the excitement of incipient war.
This was Madam La Tour, the young wife
of one of the rival French governors of Acadia.
The relations of Massachusetts, of Boston
town, to the quarrels of these two ambitious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
and unscrupulous Frenchmen, La Tour
and D’Aulnay, form one of the most curious
and interesting episodes in the history of the
colony.</p>

<p>Many unpleasant and harassing complications
and annoyances had arisen between the
French and English colonists, in the more
northern plantations, when, in 1643, in June,
Governor La Tour surprised his English
neighbors by landing in Boston “with two
friars and two women sent to wait upon La
Tour His Lady”—and strange sights they
truly were in Boston. He came ashore at
Governor Winthrop’s garden (now Fort Winthrop),
and his arrival was heralded by a
frightened woman, one Mrs. Gibbons, who
chanced to be sailing in the bay, and saw the
approach of the French boat, and hastened
to warn the Governor. Perhaps Mrs. Gibbons
had a premonitory warning of the
twenty-five hundred pounds her husband
was to lose at a later date through his confidence
in the persuasive Frenchman. Governor
and Madam Winthrop and their two
sons and a daughter-in-law were sitting in
the Governor’s garden in the summer sunshine,
and though thoroughly surprised, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
greeted the unexpected visitor, La Tour,
with civilities, and escorted him to Boston
town, not without some internal tremors and
much deep mortification of the Governor
when he thought of the weakness and poverty
of Boston, with Castle Island deserted,
as was plainly shown to the foreigner by the
lack of any response to his salute of guns;
and the inference was quick to come that the
Frenchman “might have spoiled Boston.”</p>

<p>But La Tour’s visit was most friendly; all
he wished was free mercature and the coöperation
of the English colony. And he desired
to land his men for a short time, that they
might refresh themselves after their long
voyage; “so they landed in small companies
that our women might not be affrighted with
them.” And the Governor dined the French
officers, and the New England warriors of
the train-band entertained the visiting Gallic
soldiers, and they exercised and trained before
each other, all in true Boston hospitable
fashion, as is the custom to this day. And
the Governor bourgeoned with as much of an
air of importance as possible, “being regularly
attended with a good guard of halberts
and musketeers;” and thus tried to live down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
the undignified heralding of a fellow-governor
by a badly scared woman neighbor. And the
cunning Frenchman, as did another of his
race, “with sugared words sought to addulce
all matters.” He flattered the sober Boston
magistrates, and praised everything about
the Boston army, and “showed much admiration
professing he could not have believed it,
if he had not seen it.” And the foreigners
were so well treated (though Winthrop was
blamed afterwards by stern Endicott and the
Rome-hating ministers) that they came again
the following summer, when La Tour asked
material assistance. He received it, and he
lingered till autumn, and barely eight days
after he left, Madam La Tour landed in Boston
from London; and strange and sad must
the little town have seemed to her after her
past life. She was in a state of much anger,
and at once brought suit against the master
of the ship for not carrying her and her belongings
to the promised harbor in Acadia;
for trading on the way until she nearly fell
into the hands of her husband’s enemy,
D’Aulnay. The merchants of Charlestown
and Salem sided with the ship’s captain.
The solid men of Boston gallantly upheld<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
and assisted the lady. The jury awarded her
two thousand pounds damages, and bitterly
did one of the jury—Governor Winthrop’s
son—suffer for it, for he was afterwards
arrested in London, and had to give bond
for four thousand pounds to answer to a suit
in the Court of Admiralty about the Boston
decision in favor of the Lady La Tour.</p>

<p>In the mean time ambassadors from the
rival Acadian governor, D’Aulnay, arrived
in New England, and were treated with
much honor and consideration by the diplomatic
Boston magistrates. I think I can
read between the lines that the Bostonians
really liked La Tour, who must have had
much personal attraction and magnetism;
but they feared D’Aulnay, who had brought
against the Massachusetts government a
claim of eight thousand pounds damages.
The Governor sent to D’Aulnay a propitiatory
gift of “a very fair new sedan chair (of
no use to us),” and I should fancy scarcely
of much more use in Acadia; and which
proved a very cheap way of staving off paying
the eight thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Madam La Tour sailed off at last with
three laden ships to her husband, in spite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
of D’Aulnay’s dictum that “she was known
to be the cause of all her husband’s contempt
and rebellion, and therefore they
could not let her go to him.” La Tour’s
stronghold was captured shortly after “by
assault and scalado” when he was absent,
and his jewels, plate, and furniture to the
amount of ten thousand pounds were seized,
and his wife too; and she died in three
weeks, of a broken heart, and “her little
child and gentlewomen were sent to France.”</p>

<p>I think these Boston neighbors were entitled
to a little harmless though exciting
gossip two or three years later, when they
learned that after D’Aulnay’s death the
fascinating widower La Tour had promptly
married Widow D’Aulnay, thus regaining
his jewels and plate, and both had
settled down to a long and
peaceful life in Nova
Scotia.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br><span class="small">A FEARFULL FEMALE TRAVAILLER.</span></h2></div>


<p>In the autumn and winter of the year
1704, Madam Sarah Knight, a resident
of Boston, made a journey on horseback
from Boston to New York, and returned in
the same manner. It was a journey difficult
and perilous, “full of buggbears to a fearfull
female travailler,” and which “startled a
masculine courage,” but which was performed
by this woman with the company
and protection only of hired guides, the
“Western Post,” or whatever chance traveller
she might find journeying her way, at
a time when brave men feared to travel
through New England, and asked for public
prayers in church before starting on a journey
of twenty miles. She was probably the
first woman who made such a journey, in
such a manner, in this country.</p>

<p>Madam Knight was the daughter of Captain
Kemble, of Boston, who was in 1656 set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
two hours in the public stocks as a punishment
for his “lewd and unseemly behavior,”
which consisted in his kissing his wife “publicquely”
on the Sabbath Day, upon the
doorstep of his house, when he had just
returned from a voyage and absence of three
years.</p>

<p>The diary which Madam kept on this
eventful trip contains the names of no persons
of great historical interest, though
many of historical mention; but it is such a
vivacious and sprightly picture of the customs
of the time, and such a valuable description
of localities as they then appeared,
that it has an historical interest of its own,
and is a welcome addition to the few diaries
and records of the times which we possess.</p>

<p>Everything was not all serene and pleasant
in the years 1704 and 1705 in New
England. Events had occurred which could
not have been cheerful for Madam Knight
to think of when riding through the lonely
Narragansett woods and along the shores of
the Sound. News of the frightful Indian
massacre at Deerfield had chilled the very
hearts of the colonists. At Northampton
shocking and most unexpected cruelties had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
been perpetrated by the red men. At Lancaster,
not any too far from Boston, the Indians
had been most obstreperous. We can
imagine Madam Knight had no very pleasant
thoughts of these horrors when she
wrote her description of the red men whom
she saw in such numbers in Connecticut.
Bears and wolves, too, abounded in the lonely
woods of Massachusetts and Connecticut.
The howls of wolves were heard every night,
and rewards were paid by New England
towns for the heads of wolves that were
killed, provided the heads were brought into
town and nailed to the side of the meeting-house.
Twenty-one years later than Madam
Knight’s journey, in 1725, twenty bears were
killed in one week in September, within two
miles of Boston, so says the <i>History of Roxbury</i>;
and all through the eighteenth century
bears were hunted and killed in upper
Narragansett. Hence “buggbears” were
not the only bears to be dreaded on the
lonely journey.</p>

<p>The year 1704 was memorable also because
it gave birth to the first newspaper in the
colonies, the <i>Boston News-Letter</i>. Only a
few copies were printed each week, and each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
copy contained but four or five square feet
of print, and the first number contained but
one advertisement—that of the man who
printed it.</p>

<p>When Madam Knight’s journal was published
in New York by Mr. Theodore Dwight,
in 1825, the editor knew nothing of the diarist,
not even her family name; hence it
was confidently believed by many that the
journal was merely a clever and entertaining
fiction. In 1852, however, Miss Caulkins
published her history of the town of New
London, and contradicted that belief, for she
gave an account of the last days of Madam
Knight, which were spent in Norwich and
New London. Madam Knight’s daughter
married the Colonel Livingston who is mentioned
in the journal, and left no children.
From a descendant of Mrs. Livingston’s
administratrix, Mrs. Christopher, the manuscript
of the journal was obtained for publication
in 1825, it having been carefully
preserved all those years. In <i>Blackwood’s
Magazine</i> for the same year an article appeared,
entitled <i>Travelling in America</i>, which
reprinted nearly all of Madam Knight’s journal,
and which showed a high appreciation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
of its literary and historical merits. In 1858
it was again printed by request in <i>Littell’s
Living Age</i>, with some notes of Madam
Knight’s life, chiefly compiled from Miss
Caulkins’ <i>History of New London</i>, and again
provoked much inquiry and discussion. Recently
a large portion of the journal has
been reprinted in the <i>Library of American
Literature</i>, with many alterations, however,
in the spelling, use of capitals, and punctuation,
thus detracting much from the interest
and quaintness of the work; and most unnecessarily,
since it is perfectly easy to read
and understand it as first printed, when,
as the editor said, “the original orthography
was carefully preserved for fear of introducing
any unwarrantable modernism.”</p>

<p>The first edition is now seldom seen for
sale, and being rare is consequently high-priced.
The little shabby, salmon-colored
copy of the book which I saw was made interesting
by two manuscript accounts of
Sarah Knight, which were inserted at the
end of the book, and which are very valuable,
since they give positive proof of the
reality of the fair traveller, as well as additional
facts of her life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>The first account was in a fine old-fashioned,
unpunctuated handwriting, on yellow,
time-stained paper, and read thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Madam Knight was born in Boston She was
the daughter of Capt. Kemble who was a rich
merchant of Boston he was a native of Great
Britain settled in Boston built him a large house
for that day near New North Square in the year
1676 this daughter Sarah Kemble was married
to a son of a London trader by the name of
Knight he died abroad and left her a smart
young widow in October 1703 she made a journey
to New York to claim some property of his
there. She returned on horse-backe March 1705
Soon after her return she opened a school for
children Dr. Frankelin and Dr Saml Mather
secured their first rudiments of Education from
her her parents both died and as She was the
only child they left she continued to keep school
in the Mansion house till the year 1714. She
then sold the estate to Peter Papillion he died
not long after in the year 1736 Thomas Hutchinson
Esqr purchased the estate of John Wolcott,
who was administrator of the Papillion estate Mr
Hutchinson gave the estate to his daughter Hannah
who was the wife of Dr Saml Mather. The
force of Madam Knight’s Diamond Ring was
displayed on several panes of glass in the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
house in the year 1763 Dr Mather had the house
new glazed and one pane of glass was preserved
as a curiosity for years till 1775 it was lost at the
conflagration when Charlestown was burnt by
the British June 17th. The lines on the pane of
glass were committed to memory by the present
writer. She was an original genius our ideas of
Madam are formed from hearing Dr Frankelin
and Dr Mather converse about their old school
misstress</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">as spelt on the pane of glass.</p>
</div>

<p>Underneath this account was written in
the clear, distinct chirography of Isaiah
Thomas, the veteran printer, this endorsement:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The above was written by Mrs. Hannabell
Crocker, of Boston, granddaughter of the Rev.
Cotton Mather, and presented to me by that
lady.—<span class="smcap">Isaiah Thomas.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The other manuscript account is substantially
the same, though in a different handwriting;
it tells of the pane of glass with the
rhymed inscription being “preserved as a
curiosity by an antiquicrity” (which is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
delightful and useful old word-concoction),
“until the British set fire to the town,” in
Revolutionary times, and “Poor Madam
Knight’s poetrys, with other curiosities, were
consumed.” It says, “She obtained the
honorable title of Madam by being a famous
schoolmistress in her day. She taught Dr.
Franklin to write. She was highly respected
by Dr. Cotton Mather as a woman of good
wit &amp; pleasant humour.”</p>

<p>Sarah Knight was born in 1666, and thus
was about thirty-eight years old when she
made her “perilous journey.” She started
October 2d, and did not reach New York
until December 6th. Of course much of
this time was spent visiting friends and
kinsfolk in New London and New Haven,
and often, too, she had to wait to obtain
companion travellers. She rode upon the
first night of her journey until very late in
order to “overtake the post,” and this is the
account of her reception at her first lodging-place:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My guide dismounted and very complasently
and shewed the door signing to me with his hand
to Go in, which I Gladly did. But had not gone
many steps into the room ere I was interrogated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
by a young Lady I understood afterwards was
the Eldest daughter of the family, with these,
or words to this purpose, (viz) Law for mee—what
in the world brings you here at this time-a-night?
I never see a woman on the Rode so
Dreadfull late in all my Varsall Life. Who are
You? Where are you going? I’m scar’d out of
my witts—with much now of the same Kind
I stood aghast Prepareing no reply—when in
come my Guide—to him Madam turn’d roreing
out: Lawfull heart John is it You? how de do?
Where in the world are you going with this woman?
Who is She? John made no Ans’r but
sat down in the corner, fumbled out his black
Junk, and saluted that instead of Debb. She
then turned agen to mee and fell anew into her
silly questions without asking mee to sit down.
I told her she treated mee very Rudely and I did
not think it my duty to answer her unmannerly
Questions. But to gett ridd of them I told her
I come there to have the Posts company with
me to-morrow on my Journey &amp;c. Miss stared
awhile, drew a chair bid me sitt And then run
upstairs and putts on two or three Rings (or else
I had not seen them before) and returning sett
herself just before me shewing the way to Reding,
that I might see her Ornaments.</p>
</div>

<p>It appears from this account that human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
nature, or rather feminine love of display,
was the same in colonial times as in the
present day.</p>

<p>Very vivid are her descriptions of the various
beds upon which she reposed. This is
her entry in her diary after the first night of
her journey:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I pray’d Miss to shew me where I must Lodg.
Shee conducted me to a parlour in a little back
Lento, which was almost filled with the bedstead,
which was so high that I was forced to climb
on a chair to gitt up to ye wretched bed that
lay on it, on which having Strecht my tired
Limbs, and lay’d my head on a Sad-colour’d
pillow, I began to think on the transactions of
ye past day.</p>
</div>

<p>We can imagine her (if such an intrusive
fancy is not impertinent after one hundred
and eighty years), attired in her night-hood
and her “flowered calico night-rayle with
high collared neck,” climbing wearily upon
a chair and thence to the mountainous bed
with its dingy pillow. The fashion of wearing
“immoderate great rayles” had been
prohibited by law in Massachusetts in 1634,
but the garment mentioned must have been
some kind of a loose gown worn in the day-time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
for we cannot fancy that even the meddlesome
interference and aspiring ambition
for omnipotence of those Puritan magistrates
would make them dare to attempt to control
what kind of a nightgown a woman
should wear.</p>

<p>Here is another vivid description of a
night’s lodging, where her room was shared,
as was the country custom of that time (and
indeed for many years later), by the men
who had journeyed with her:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Arriving at my apartment found it to be a
little Lento Chamber furnished amongst other
Rubbish with a High Bedd and a Low one, a
Long Table, a Bench and a Bottomless chair.
Little Miss went to scratch up my Kennell
which Russelled as if shee’d bin in the Barn
amongst the Husks, and supose such was the
contents of the tickin—nevertheless being exceeding
weary-down I laid my poor Carkes
(never more tired) and found my Covering as
scanty as my Bed was hard. Anon I heard another
Russelling noise in Ye Room—called to
know the matter—Little Miss said shee was
making a bed for the men; who, when they were
in Bed complained their leggs lay out of it by
reason of its shortness—my poor bones complained
bitterly not being used to such Lodgings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
and so did the man who was with us; and poor
I made but one Grone, which was from the time
I went to bed to the time I Riss, which was
about three in the morning, Setting up by the
Fire till Light.</p>
</div>

<p>The word “lento,” or “lean to,” was sometimes
called “linter,” and you will still hear
old-fashioned or aged country-people use the
word. The “lean-to” was the rear portion
of a form of house peculiar to New England,
which was two stories high in front, with a
roof which sloped down from a steep gable
to a very low single story at the rear.</p>

<p>Madam Sarah speaks with some surprise
throughout her travels of the height of the
beds, so it is evident that very towering beds
were not in high fashion in Boston in 1704,
in spite of the exceeding tall four-posters
that have descended to us from our ancestors,
and which surely no one could mount in modern days
without a chair as an accessory.
Even a chair was not always a sufficient
stepping-block by the bedsides that Madam
Sarah found, for she thus writes: “He invited
us to his house, and shewed me two
pair of stairs, viz, one up the loft, and tother
up the Bedd, which was as hard as it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
high, and warmed with a hott stone at the
foot.”</p>

<p>After the good old Puritan custom of contumelious
reviling, in which clergymen, laymen,
and legal lights alike joined, Madam
Knight could show a rare choice of epithets
and great fluency of uncomplimentary description
when angered. Having expected
to lodge at the house of a Mr. DeVille in
Narragansett, and being refused, she writes
thus of the DeVilles:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I questioned whether we ought to go to the
Devil to be helpt out of the affliction. However,
like the Rest of Deluded souls that post to ye
Infernall denn, Wee made all possible speed to
this Devil’s Habitation; where alliting, in full
assurance of good accommodation, wee were going
in. But meeting his two daughters, as I suposed
twins, they so neerly resembled each other
both in features and habit and look’t as old
as the Divel himself, and quite as Ugly. We
desired entertainment, but could hardly get a
word out of ’um, till with our Importunity telling
them our necessity &amp;c they call’d the old
Sophister, who was as sparing of his words as
his daughters had bin, and no or none, was the
reply’s he made us to our demands. Hee differed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
only in this from the old fellow in tother
Country, hee let us depart. However I thought
it proper to warn poor Travaillers to endeavour
to Avoid falling into circumstances like ours,
which at our next Stage I sat down and did as
followeth:—</p>

<p>Madam Knight had a habit of “dropping
into poetry” very readily and upon almost
any subject. Upon the moon, upon poverty,
even upon the noise of drunken topers in the
next room to her own. The night-scene that
brought forth the rhymes upon rum was
graced by a conversation upon the derivation
of the word Narragansett, and her report of

<p>I went to bed which tho’ pretty hard Yet neet
and handsome but I could get no sleep because
of the Clamor of some of the Town-tope-ers in
next Room who were entered into a strong debate
concerning ye Signifycation of the name of
their Country (viz) Narraganset. One said it was
named so by ye Indians because there grew a
Brier there of a prodigious Highth and bigness,
the like hardly ever known, called by the Indians
Narragansett. And quotes an Indian of so Barberous
a name for his Author that I could not
write it. His Antagonist Replyd No.—It was
from a spring it had its name, which he well knew
where it was, which was extreem cold in summer,
and as Hott as could be imagined in the winter
which was much resorted to by the natives and
by them called Narragansett (Hott &amp; Cold) and
that was the originall of their places name—with

<p>To one who, unused to venturing abroad
in boats on stormy waters, has trusted her
bodily safety to one of those ticklish Indian

sensations of an early female colonist in a
similar situation may prove of interest; nor

the description be improved by the added

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are so accustomed to hearing of the
great veneration and respect always shown
in olden times by children toward their parents,
and the dignified reserve and absolute
authority of parents towards children, that
the following scene rather shocks our established
notions:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thursday about 3 in the afternoon I set forward
with neighbour Polly &amp; Jemima a girl about
18 years old, who her father said he had been to
fetch out of the Narragansetts and said they had
rode thirty miles that day on a sorry lean Jade
with only a Bagg under her for a pillion which
the poor Girl often complain’d was very uneasy.
Wee made Good speed along wch made poor
Jemima make many a sowr face the mare being
a very hard trotter, and after many a hearty
&amp; bitter Oh she at length low’d out: Lawful
Heart father! this bare mare hurts mee Dingeely.
I’m direfull sore I vow, with many words to that
purpose. Poor Child—sais Gaffer—she us’t to
serve your mother so. I dont care how mother
ust to do, quoth Jemima in a passionate tone.
At which the old man Laught and kikt his Jade
o’ the side, which made her Jolt ten times harder.
About seven that evening we came to New London
Ferry here by reason of a very high wind,
we mett with great difficulty in getting over. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
boat tost exceedingly and our Horses cappered
at a very Surprising rate and set us all in a fright
especially poor Jemima who desired father to say
So Jack! to the Jade to make her stand. But
the careless parent, taking no notice of her
repeated desires, She Rored out in a Pasionate
manner Pray Suth father Are you deaf? Say So
Jack to the Jade I tell you. The Dutiful Parent
obeyed saying So Jack So Jack as gravely as if
he had bin saying Chatchise after young Miss
who with her fright look’t all the Colours of ye
Rainbow.</p>
</div>

<p>It is very evident from entries in her Journal
that Madam Knight thought much of
gratifying her appetite, for the food she obtained
at her different resting-places is often
described. She says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Landlady told us shee had some mutton which
shee would broil. In a little time she bro’t it in
but it being pickled and my Guide said it smelt
strong of head-sause we left it and paid six pence
apiece for our dinners which was only smell.</p>
</div>

<p>Again, she thus describes a meal:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Having call’d for something to eat the woman
bro’t in a Twisted thing like a cable, but something
whiter, laying it on the bord, tugg’d for
life to bring it into a capacity to spread; which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
having with great pains accomplished shee served
a dish of Pork and Cabage I supose the remains
of Dinner. The sause was of a deep purple
which I tho’t was boiled in her dye Kettle; the
bread was Indian and everything on the Table
service agreeable to these. I being hungry gott
a little down, but my stomach was soon cloy’d
and what cabage I swallowed served me for a
Cudd the whole day after.</p>
</div>

<p>The early colonists never turned very readily
to Indian meal and pumpkins—pumpions
as they called them in the “times wherein
old Pompion was a saint;” and Johnson,
in his <i>Wonder-Working Providence</i>, reproved
them for making a jest of pumpkins, since
they were so good a food. Madam Knight
had them offered to her very often, “pumpkin
sause” and “pumpkin bred.” “We
would have eat a morsell ourselves But the
Pumpkin and Indian-mixt Bread had such an
aspect, and the Bare-legg’d Punch so awkerd
or rather Awfull a sound that we left both.”</p>

<p>She gives a glimpse of rather awkward
table-manners when she complains that in
Connecticut masters permitted their slaves
to sit and eat with them, “and into the dish
goes the black Hoof as freely as the white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
hand.” Doubtless in those comparatively
forkless days fingers were very freely used
at the table.</p>

<p>She tells many curious facts about Connecticut.
Divorces were plentiful in that
State, as they are at the present day. She
writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These uncomely Standaways are too much in
Vogue among the English in this Indulgent Colony
as their Records plentifully prove, and that
on very trivial matters of which some have been
told me, but are not Proper to be Related by a
Female Pen.</p>
</div>

<p>She says they will not allow harmless kissing
among the young people, and she tells of
a curious custom at weddings, where the
bridegroom ran away and had to be chased
and dragged back by force to the bride.</p>

<p>Her descriptions of the city of New
York; of the public vendues “where they
give drinks;” of the Dutch houses and
women; of the “sley-riding” where she
“mett fifty or sixty sleys,” are all very entertaining.
There were few sleighs in Boston
at that date. Everything is compared
with “ours in Boston,” or said to be “not
like Boston,” after a fashion still somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
followed by the Boston “Female Pen” of
the present day. As New York then was
only a small town of five thousand inhabitants,
while Big Boston possessed ten thousand
inhabitants, such comparisons were
certainly justifiable.</p>

<p>We must give her vivid and vivacious
picture of a country “lubber” in a merchant’s
shop:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In comes a tall country fellow with his Alfogeos
full of Tobaco. He advanced to the middle
of the room, makes an awkward nodd and spitting
a large deal of Aromatic Tincture, he gave
a scrape with his shovel-like shoo, leaving a small
shovel-full of dirt on the floor, made a full stop,
hugging his own pretty body with his hands
under his arms, Stood Staring round him like a
Catt let out of a Baskett. At last like the creature
Balaam rode on he opened his mouth and
said <i>Have you any Ribinen for Hat bands to sell I
pray?</i> The Questions and answers about the
pay being past the Ribin is bro’t and opened.
Bumpkin simpers, cryes, <i>Its confounded Gay I
vow</i>; and beckoning to the door in comes Joan
Tawdry, dropping about 50 curtsies, and stands
by him. He shews her the Ribin. <i>Law You</i>,
sais shee, <i>its right Gent, do you take it, its dreadful
pretty</i>. Then she enquires: <i>Have you any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
hood silk I pray?</i> which being brought and
bought. <i>Have you any Thred silk to sew it with?</i>
says shee, which being accomodated with they
departed.</p>
</div>

<p>Though Madam Knight left no account
of the costume which she wore on her
“perilous journey,” we know very well what
the fashions of the time were and of what
her dress consisted. She wore a woollen
round-gown, perhaps of camlet, perhaps of
calimanco, of which the puffed sleeves came
to the elbow and were finished with knots
of ribbons and ruffles. Riding-habits were
then never worn. I am sure she did not
wear a neck-ruff on this journey, but a scarf
or neck-kerchief or “cross cloth” instead.
Long gloves of leather or kid protected her
fair hands, and came to the elbow, and were
firmly secured at the top by “glove-tightens”
made of braided black horsehair. A pointed
beaver or beaverette hat covered her head;
the hat and peruke had not then reached the
excessive size which made them for a lady’s
“riding equipage” so bitterly and openly
condemned in 1737 as an exceeding and
abominable affectation. She doubtless wore
instead of the fine, stately peruke, a cap, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
“round cap,” which did not cover the ears,
or a “strap cap,” which came under the chin;
or perhaps a “quoif” or a “ciffer”—New
England French for <i>coiffure</i>. During her
cold winter ride home she surely donned a
hood. One is described at that date thus:
“A woman’s worsted camlet riding-hood of
grayish color faced with crimson coulour’d
Persian.” Over her shoulders she wore a
heavy woollen short cloak, or a scarlet “whittle,”
and doubtless also added a “drugget-petticoat”
for warmth, or a “safeguard” for
protection against mud. High-heeled pointed
shoes of leather, with knots of green ribbon
or silver buckles, completed Madam Sarah’s
picturesque and comfortable attire. One
other useful article of dress, or rather of
protection, she surely as a lady of high gentility
carried and wore: a riding-mask made
of black velvet with a silver mouthpiece, or
with two little strings with a silver bead at
the end, which she placed in either corner
of her mouth, to hold her mask firmly in
place.</p>

<p>The “nagg” upon which Madam rode was
without doubt a pacer, as were all good saddle-horses
at that date. No one making any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
pretension to fashion or good style would
ride upon a trotting-horse, nor indeed until
Revolutionary times was a trotter regarded
as of any account or worth.</p>

<p>I do not think Madam Knight had a Narragansett
pacer, for as soon as they were
raised in any numbers they were sent at once
to the West Indies for the use of the wives
and daughters of the wealthy sugar-planters,
and few New England people could afford to
own them. The “horse furniture” of which
she speaks included, of course, her side-saddle
and saddle-bag, which held her travelling-wardrobe
and her precious journal.</p>

<p>Madam Sarah Knight did not end her
days in Boston. She removed to Norwich,
Conn., and in 1717 it is recorded that she
gave a silver cup for the communion-service
of the church there. The town in gratitude,
by vote, gave her liberty to “sitt in the pue
where she was used to sitt in ye meeting
house.” She also kept an inn on the Livingston
Farm near New London, and I
doubt not a woman of her large experience
kept a good ordinary. No rustling beds, no
sad-colored pillow-bears, no saucy maids, no
noisy midnight topers, no doubtful fricassees,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
no pumpkin-bread, and, above all, no bare-legged
punch in her house.</p>

<p>It is painful to record, however, that in
1718 the teacher of Benjamin Franklin and
friend of Cotton Mather was indicted and
fined for “selling strong liquor to Indians.”</p>

<p>Altogether, Madam Knight was far ahead
of the time in which she lived. She was a
woman of great energy and talent. She kept
a school when a woman-teacher was almost
unheard of. She ran a tavern, a shop. She
wrote poetry and a diary. She cultivated a
farm, and owned mills, and speculated largely
in Indian lands, and was altogether a sharp
business-woman; and she must have
been counted an extraordinary
character in those early
days.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br><span class="small">TWO COLONIAL ADVENTURESSES.</span></h2></div>


<p>A “strange true story of Louisiana”
so furnished with every attractive
element of romance, so calculated to satisfy
every exaction of literary art, that it seems
marvellous it has not been eagerly seized
upon and frequently utilized by dramatists
and novelists, is that of a Louisiana princess—or
pretender—whose death in a Parisian
convent in 1771 furnished a fruitful topic of
speculation and conversation in the courts
of France, Austria, Russia, and Prussia.
This Louisiana princess (were she no pretender)
was the daughter-in-law of Peter the
Great of Russia, wife of the Grand Duke
Alexis, and mother of Peter II. of Russia.
The story, as gathered from a few European
authorities and some old French chronicles
and histories of Louisiana, is this.</p>

<p>The Princess Christine, daughter of a German
princeling and wife of the Grand Duke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
Alexis, is said by Russian official and historical
records to have died in 1716 after a short
and most unhappy married life with a brutal
royal profligate, and to have been buried
with proper court honors and attendance.
But there is another statement, half-history,
half-romance, which denies that she died at
that time, and asserts that her death and
burial were but a carefully planned deception,
to permit her to escape her intolerable
life in Russia, and only concealed her successful
flight from St. Petersburg and the
power of the Russian throne. Aided by the
famous Countess Königsmark, the princess,
after some delay and frightened hiding in
France, sailed from the port of L’Orient,
accompanied by an old devoted court retainer
named Walter. Of course there must
always be a lover to form a true romance,
and a young officer named D’Aubant successfully
fills that rôle. He had often seen
Christine in the Russian court, and had
rescued her from danger when she was hunting
in the Hartz Mountains, and had cherished
for her a deep though hopeless love. When
the news of her death came to the knowledge
of Chevalier D’Aubant, he sadly left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
the Czar’s service and went to France.
Soon after he chanced to see at the cathedral
in Poitiers a woman who raised her veil,
glanced at him with a look of recognition,
and apparently a face like that of his loved
Christine. After long search for the unknown,
he found her temporary home, only
to learn that she, with her father Mons.
De L’Ecluse (who was of course Walter),
had just sailed for the New World. But the
woman of the house gave him a slip of paper
which the fair one had left for him in case
he called and asked concerning her. On it
was written this enigmatical lure:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I have drunk of the waters of Lethe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hope yet remains to me.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, he would not have been an ideal court-lover,
nor indeed but a sorry hero, if, after
such a message, he had not promply sailed
after the possible Christine. He learned
that the vessel which bore her was to land
at Biloxi, Louisiana. He sailed for the same
port with his fortune in his pockets. But
on arriving in Louisiana, Walter (or Mons.
De L’Ecluse) had taken the disguising name
of Walter Holden, and Christine posed as
his daughter, Augustine Holden; so her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
knight-errant thus lost trace of her. Christine-Augustine
and her father settled in the
Colonie Roland on the Red River. D’Aubant,
with sixty colonists, founded a settlement
but fifty miles away, which he named
the Valley of Christine. Of course in due
time the lovers met, and disguise was impossible
and futile, and Augustine confessed
her identity with the Crown Princess. As
her husband Alexis had by this time conveniently
died in prison, in Moscow, where
he had been tried and condemned to death
(and probably been privately executed), there
was no reason, save the memory of her past
exalted position, why she should not become
the wife of an honest planter. They were
married by a Spanish priest, and lived for
twenty happy years in the Valley of Christine.</p>

<p>But D’Aubant’s health failed, and he
sought physicians in Paris. One day when
Christine was walking in the garden of the
Tuileries, with her two daughters, the children
of D’Aubant, the German conversation
of the mother attracted the attention of Marshal
Saxe, who was the son of the very
Countess Königsmark who had aided Christine’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
escape. The marshal recognized the
princess at once, in spite of the lapse of
years, and through his influence with Louis
XV. obtained for D’Aubant a commission as
major of troops, and the office of governor
of the Isle of Bourbon. The King also
informed the Empress of Austria, who was
a niece of Christine, that her aunt was alive;
and an invitation was sent from the Empress
for the D’Aubant family to become residents
of the Austrian Court. They remained,
however, at the Isle of Bourbon until the
death of D’Aubant and the two daughters,
when Christine came to Brunswick and was
granted a pension for life by the Empress.
Her death in a convent, and her burial, took
place over half a century after her pretended
legal demise.</p>

<p>This is the Christine of romance, of court
gossip, of court credulity, but there is another
aspect of her story. Judge Martin
has written a standard history of Louisiana.
In it he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Two hundred German settlers of Law’s grant
were landed in the month of March 1721 at Biloxi
out of the twelve hundred who had been
recruited. There came among the German new-comers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
a female adventurer. She had been attached
to the wardrobe of the wife of the Czarowitz
Alexis Petrovitz, the only son of Peter the
Great. She imposed on the credulity of many
persons, particularly on that of an officer of the
garrison of Mobile (called by Bossu, the Chevalier
D’Aubant, and by the King of Prussia, Waldeck),
who, having seen the princess at St. Petersburg
imagined he recognized her features in
those of her former servant, and gave credit to
the report that she was the Duke of Wolfenbuttel’s
daughter, and the officer married her.</p>
</div>

<p>Grimm and Voltaire in their letters, Levesque
in his History, all unite in pronouncing
her an impostor. But you can choose
your own estimate of this creature of high
romance; if you elect to deem her a princess,
you find yourself in the goodly company
of the King of France, the Empress of
Austria, Marshal Saxe, and a vast number
of other folk of rank and intelligence.</p>

<p>In the year 1771 there was sent to this
country from England a woman convict,
who had in her enforced home a most extraordinary
and romantic career of successful
fraud.</p>

<p>The first account which I have seen of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
her was printed in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>
in 1771, and told simply of her startling
intrusion into the Queen’s apartments
in London; but Dr. Doran’s <i>Lives of the
Queens of England of the House of Hanover</i>
gives this account of this interesting bit
of Anglo-American romance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sarah Wilson, yielding to a strong temptation
in the year 1771, filched one or two of the
Queen’s jewels, and was condemned to be executed.
It was considered almost a violation of
justice that the thief should be saved from the
halter and be transported instead of hanged.
She was sent to America, where she was allotted
as slave, or servant, to a Mr. Dwale, Bud Creek,
Frederick County. Queen Charlotte would have
thought nothing more of her, had her majesty
not heard with some surprise, that her sister
Susannah Caroline Matilda was keeping her
court in the plantations. Never was surprise
more genuine than the Queen’s; it was exceeded
only by her hilarity when it was discovered that
the Princess Susannah was simply Sarah Wilson,
at large. That somewhat clever girl having
stolen a Queen’s jewels, thought nothing, after
escaping from the penal service to which she
was condemned, of passing herself off as a
Queen’s sister. The Americans were not so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
acute as their descendants; so in love were
some of them with the greatness they affected to
despise, that they paid royal honors to the clever
impostor. She passed the most joyous of seasons
before she was consigned again to increase
of penalty for daring to pretend relationship with
the consort of King George. The story of the
presuming girl, whose escapades, however, were
not fully known in England at that time, served,
as far as knowledge of them had reached the
court, to amuse the gossips who had assembled
about the cradle of the young Elizabeth.</p>
</div>

<p>In this account of Dr. Doran’s there are
some errors. The real story of the crime
of Sarah Wilson and her subsequent career
was this. In August, 1770, a strange woman
found her way by means of a private staircase
to the apartments of Queen Charlotte.
She entered a room where the Queen and
the Duchess of Ancaster were sitting, to
their alarm. While she was taking a leisurely
survey of the contents of the room,
a page was summoned, who expelled the intruder,
but did not succeed in arresting her.
Shortly after, the Queen’s apartments were
broken into by a thief, who stole valuable
jewels and a miniature of the Queen. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
thief proved to be a woman named Sarah
Wilson, who had been maid of the Honorable
Miss Vernon, and this thief was asserted to
be the inquisitive intruder whose visit had
so alarmed the Queen.</p>

<p>Sarah Wilson was arrested, tried as a felon,
and sentenced to death; but by the exertions
and influence of her former mistress the
sentence was commuted to transportation to
the American colonies for a seven years’
term of servitude. This leniency caused
considerable stir in London and some dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>In 1771, after passage in a convict ship,
Sarah Wilson was sold to a Mr. William
Duvall, of Bush Creek, Frederick County,
Maryland, for seven years’ servitude. After
a short time, in which she apparently developed
her plans of fraud, she escaped from
her master, and went to Virginia and the
Carolinas, where she assumed the title of
Princess Susannah Caroline Matilda, and asserted
she was the sister of the Queen of
England. She still owned the miniature of
the Queen, and some rich jewels, which gave
apparent proof of her assertion, and it is
said some rich clothing. It is indeed mysterious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
that a transported convict could
retain in her possession, through all her
reverses, the very jewels for whose theft she
was punished; yet the story can scarcely be
doubted.</p>

<p>She travelled through the South from
plantation to plantation, with plentiful promises
of future English offices and court
favors to all who assisted her progress; and
liberal sums of money were placed at her
disposal, to be repaid by Queen Charlotte;
and she seems to have been universally welcomed
and feasted.</p>

<p>But the fame of the royal visitor spread
afar and found its way to Bush Creek, to the
ears of Mr. Duvall, and he promptly suspected
that he had found trace of his ingenious
runaway servant. As was the custom
of the day, he advertised for her and a reward
for her capture. The notice reads thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Bush Creek, Frederick County, Maryland, October
11, 1771. Ran away from the subscriber
a convict servant named <span class="smcap">Sarah Wilson</span>, but has
changed her name to Lady Susannah Caroline
Matilda, which made the public believe that she
was her Majesty’s sister. She has a blemish in
her right eye, black roll’d hair, stoops in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
shoulders, and makes a common practice of writing
and marking her clothes with a crown and
a B. Whoever secures the said servant woman
or will take her home, shall receive five pistoles,
besides all cost of charges. William Duvall.</p>

<p>I entitle Michael Dalton to search the city of
Philadelphia, and from there to Charleston, for
the said woman.</p>

<p>Beauty readily inspires confidence, and dignity
commands it. But a woman with such
scant personal charms, with a blemish in her
eye and stooping shoulders, must have been
most persuasive in conversation to have surmounted
such obstacles. It is said that she
was most gracious, yet commanding.</p>

<p>To elude Michael Dalton’s authorized
search from Philadelphia to Charleston,
Sarah Wilson fled from her scenes of success,
but also of too familiar and extensive
acquaintance, to New York. But New York
proved still too near to Maryland, so she took
passage for Newport. Here her fame preceded
her, for in the <i>Newport Mercury</i> of
November 29, 1773, is this notice:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Last Tuesday arrived here from New York
the lady who has passed through several of the
southern colonies under the name and character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
of <span class="smcap">Caroline Matilda</span>, Marchioness de Waldgrave,
etc., etc.</p>
</div>

<p>I do not know the steps that led to her
capture and removal, but at the end of the
year the Marchioness was back on William
Duvall’s plantation, and bound to serve a
redoubled term of years. It seems to be
probable that she also suffered more ignoble
punishment, for Judge Martin says in his
<i>History of Louisiana</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A female driven for her misconduct from the
service of a maid of honor of Princess Matilda,
sister of George III., was convicted at the Old
Bailey and transported to Maryland. She effected
her escape before the expiration of her
time, and travelled through Virginia and both
the Carolinas personating the Princess, and levying
contributions on the credulity of the planters
and merchants and even some of the king’s officers.
She was at last arrested in Charleston,
prosecuted and whipped.</p>
</div>

<p>I often wonder what became of the Brummagem
princess, with her jewels and her
personal blemishes; and I often fancy that
I find traces of her career, still masquerading,
still imposing on simple folk. For instance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
Rev. Manasseh Cutler wrote, at his home in
Ipswich Hamlet, Mass., on January 25, 1775:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A lady came to our house who had made a
great noise in the country, and has been made
the occasion of various conjectures. She calls
herself Caroline Augusta Harriet, Duchess of
Brownstonburges. Says she has resided in the
Court of England for several years, that she
eloped from the palace of St. James. She appears
to be a person of an extraordinary education,
and well acquainted with things at Court,
but she is generally supposed to be an impostor.</p>
</div>

<p>Three days later he writes that he “conveyed
the extraordinary visitor to town in a
chaise.” With this glimpse of Sarah—if
Sarah she were—visiting in a little New
England town in a sober Puritan family, and
riding off to Boston in a chaise with the
pious Puritan preacher, she vanishes from
our ken, to be obscured in the smoke of
battle and the din of war, and forced
to learn that to American patriots
it was no endearing trait to
pose as an English
princess.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br><span class="small">THE UNIVERSAL FRIEND.</span></h2></div>


<p>Sir Thomas Browne says that “all
heresies, how gross soever, have found
a welcome with the people.” Certainly they
have with the people, and specially they
have with the Rhode Island people. The
eighty-two pestilent heresies so sadly deplored
by the Puritan divines found a home
in Rhode Island and the Providence Plantations.
It was not strange, therefore, that
from the heart of Narragansett should spring
one of the most remarkable and successful
religious woman-fanatics the world has
ever known. Jemima Wilkinson was born
in the town of Cumberland, R. I., in 1758.
Though her father was a poor farmer, she
came of no mean stock. She was a descendant
of English kings—of King Edward I.—and
later of Lieutenant Wilkinson, of
Cromwell’s army, and she was a second cousin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
of Governor Stephen Hopkins and Commodore
Hopkins.</p>

<p>When she was eight years old her mother
died, leaving her to the care of older sisters,
whom she soon completely dominated. She
was handsome, fond of ease and dress, vain,
and eager for attention. She was romantic
and impressionable, and when a new sect of
religious zealots, called Separatists, appeared
in her neighborhood—a sect who rejected
church organization and insisted upon direct
guidance from heaven—she became one of
the most regular attendants at their meetings.</p>

<p>She soon betook herself to solitude and
study of the Bible, and seemed in deep reflection,
and at last kept wholly to her room,
and then went to bed. She was at that time
but eighteen years old, and it scarcely seems
possible that she deliberately planned out her
system of life-long deception which proved
so successful; but soon she began to see
visions, which she described to her sisters
and visitors, and interpreted to them.</p>

<p>Finally she fell in a deep trance, which
lasted thirty-six hours, during which she
scarcely breathed. About the middle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
the second day, when surrounded by anxious
watchers (who proved valuable witnesses in
her later career), she rose up majestically,
called for clothing, dressed herself, and
walked about fully restored and calm, though
pale. But she announced that Jemima Wilkinson
had died, and that her body was now
inhabited by a spirit whose mission was to
deliver the oracles of God to mankind, and
who was to be known henceforth by the
name of the Universal Friend. It ought to
be noted here that this girl of eighteen not
only maintained these absurd claims of resurrection
of the body and reincarnation, at
that time, in the face of the expostulation
and arguments of her relatives and friends,
but also with unshaken firmness, and before
all hearers, till the day of her death at the
age of sixty-one.</p>

<p>On the first Sunday after her trance, the
Universal Friend preached in the open air
near her home to a large and excited gathering
of people; and she electrified her audience
by her eloquence, her brilliant imagination,
her extraordinary familiarity with
the Scriptures, and her facility and force of
application and quotation from them. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
success in obtaining converts was most
marked from the first, as was her success
in obtaining temporal comforts and benefits
from these converts. In this she resembled
the English religious adventuress, Johanna
Southcote. For six years she lived at the
house of Judge William Potter, in South
Kingstown, R. I. This handsome house
was known as the Abbey. He enlarged it
by building a splendid suite of rooms for his
beloved spiritual leader, on whom he lavished
his large fortune.</p>

<p>Her success as a miracle-worker was not
so great. She announced that on a certain
date she would walk upon the water, but
when, in the face of a large multitude, she
reached the water’s edge, she denounced the
lack of faith of her followers, and refused to
gratify their curiosity by trying the experiment.
Nor did she succeed in her attempt
to raise from the dead one Mistress Susanna
Potter, the daughter of Judge Potter, who
died during Jemima’s residence at the Abbey.
She managed, however, to satisfy fully her
followers by foretelling events, interpreting
dreams, and penetrating secrets, which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
worded by ingeniously mystic and easily applicable
terms.</p>

<p>Her meetings and her converts were not
confined to Rhode Island. In southern
Massachusetts and Connecticut many joined
her band. In New Milford, Conn., her converts
erected a meeting-house. In 1782 she
started out upon a new mission. With a
small band of her disciples she went to
Philadelphia, where she was cordially received
and entertained by the Quakers. In
Worcester, Pa., her reception was enthusiastic.
Scarce a diary of those times but
contains some allusion to her or her career.
In the journal of Jacob Hiltzeheimer, of
Philadelphia, I read:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Aug. 15, 1783. Returning from church, I observed
people crowded about the Free Quakers
meeting-house, and was told they were waiting
to see the wonderful Jemima Wilkinson who had
preached. I remained till she came out to get
in her chair. She had on a white hat but no cap,
and a white linen garment that covered her to
her feet.</p>

<p>Aug. 20, 1783. Went to the new Quaker
meeting-house on Arch Street to hear Jemima<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
Wilkinson preach. She looks more like a man
than a woman.</p>

<p>May 22, 1788. I rode out to Cunninghams
Centre House to hear the famous Jemima Wilkinson
preach, and in the room where formerly a
billiard table stood I saw and heard her. She
spoke much in the New England dialect. She
appeared to be about twenty-five years of age,
her hair was dressed like that of a man, and she
wore a black gown after the fashion of church
ministers.</p>
</div>

<p>The manuscript diary of the Reverend
John Pitman, of Providence, R. I., says:
“Saw that poor deluded creature Jemima
Wilkerson and a number of her dull followers
standing staring at the cross-roads.”</p>

<p>In the days of reaction after the excitement
of the Revolution, many aspirations
for a better social state prompted settlements
in outlying portions of the Central States.
Communities were founded, Utopias were
planned, and soon the united body of people
known as the Friend’s followers decided to
seek in the depths of the wilderness a new
home. It was a bold undertaking, but the
band had a bold commander, and above all,
they were absolute in their confidence in her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
In no way was that confidence shown so remarkably
as in the fact that the settlement
was made for her but without her. The
three delegates sent to find a place suitable
for their purpose reported in favor of the
region at the foot of Seneca Lake in the
State of New York. In 1788 the settlement
was made on the west shore of the lake by
twenty-five persons, on the primitive highway
of the region, about a mile south of
Dresden, and it was named Jerusalem.</p>

<p>For over two years a band of determined
believers labored in this wilderness to prepare
a home for their leader, who was comfortably
carrying on her triumphant and
flattering progress in the large cities. Surrounded
by Indians, and menaced by wild
beasts, they cleared the forests, and planted
wheat, and lived on scant food. During the
first year one family for six weeks had only
boiled nettles and bohea tea for nourishment.
When the cornfields yielded the second summer,
a small grist-mill was built with incredible
labor. When the well-fed and not at all
over-worked Friend arrived, she found an
orderly, industrious community of two hundred
and sixty persons, who had built for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
her a home and a meeting-house, and she
at once settled down in comparative comfort
in the midst of her flock.</p>

<p>The house which was occupied by the
Friend was a log-house of humble pretensions;
to this two or three houses were
added, then upper stories were placed over
all, and framed in. It stood in a fine garden,
and by its side was a long building used as a
workshop for the women of the settlement,
where spinning, weaving, and sewing were
constantly carried on. Near by stood the
sugar grove, a most lucrative possession of
the society. From this home the Friend
and her steadfast followers would ride in
imposing cavalcade, two by two, to meeting
at the early settlement. With their handsome,
broad-brimmed hats, substantial clothes,
and excellent horses, they made a most notable
and impressive appearance. Her second
house was more pretentious and comparatively
luxurious; in it she lived till the time
of her death.</p>

<p>Jemima Wilkinson’s followers were of no
poor or ordinary stock. Many brought to
her community considerable wealth. Into
the wilderness went with her from Kingstown,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
R. I., Judge William Potter and his
daughters; a family of wealthy Hazards;
Captain James Parker (brother of Sir Peter
Parker); four Reynolds sisters from a family
of dignity; Elizabeth Luther and seven children;
members of the Card, Hunt, Sherman,
and Briggs families. From New Milford,
Conn., emigrated a number of Stones and
Botsfords, and from New Bedford many members
of the influential Hathaway and Lawrence
families. From Stonington and New
London went a large number of Barneses
and Browns and Davises; from Philadelphia
the entire family of Malins and the Supplees;
from Worcester, Pa., came a most important
recruit, Daniel Wagener, with his
sister, and Jonathan Davis, and other well-to-do
and influential persons.</p>

<p>The most important converts to belief in
her doctrines, and pioneers for her, were
doubtless Judge Potter and Captain Parker,
both men of large wealth and unstinted liberality
to their leader. The former had been
treasurer of the State of Rhode Island; the
latter had been also a magistrate for twenty
years in the same State. They were the
largest contributors to the fund for the purchase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
of the tract of land in New York.
These men sacrificed home and friends to
come to the New Jerusalem with their adored
priestess; but they quickly escaped from her
sway, and became in later years her most
powerful enemies. They even issued a complaint
against her for blasphemy. The officer
who tried to serve the warrant upon her
was unable to seize the Friend, who was an
accomplished rider and well mounted, and,
when he went to her house, was roughly
treated and driven away. John Lawrence,
whose wife was Anna Hathaway, was a near
relative of Commodore Lawrence; he was a
shipbuilder at New Bedford, and, though he
followed Jemima Wilkinson to Seneca Lake,
never joined her society. Many of her believers
never lived in her settlement, but visited
her there; and many bequeathed to her
liberally by will, and made valuable gifts to
her during their life.</p>

<p>In the main, the influence of this remarkable
woman continued unabated with a large
number of her followers throughout her life,
and even after her death. This power survived
against the adverse conditions of frequent
litigations, personal asperities, constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
injurious reports, and the dislike of
many to the strictness of her faith and austerity
of life required by her from her followers.
This allegiance could hardly have been
founded solely on religious credulity, but
must have depended largely in her attractive
personal traits, her humanity, and doubtless
also to her attractive expositions of her lively
imagination. To the last she persisted in
calling herself by the sole name of the Universal
Friend. Even her will was signed
thus: “I, the person once called Jemima
Wilkinson, but in and ever since the year
1777 known as and called the Public Universal
Friend, hereunto set my name and seal;
Public Universal Friend.” But she cannily
appended a sub-signature over a cross-mark
of the name of her youth.</p>

<p>A remarkable feature of the Universal
Friend’s Society, perhaps the most remarkable
effect of her teachings, was the large
number of excellent women who, as persistent
celibates, adhered to her teachings
throughout their lives. Some lived in her
house, and all were consistent representatives
of her doctrines, and many lived to
great old age. Nor can I doubt from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
accounts of their lives that they were exceedingly
happy in their celibacy and in
their unwavering belief in Jemima Wilkinson.
Carlyle says, “Man’s gullibility is not
his worst blessing.” I may paraphrase his
assertion thus—woman’s gullibility is one
of her most comforting traits. Her persistent
belief, her unswerving devotion, often to
wholly unworthy objects, brings its own reward
in a lasting, though unreasoning satisfaction.</p>

<p>Jemima’s male adherents were nearly all
married. It was her intention that her property,
which was considerable, should be held
for the benefit of her followers who survived
her, but it was gradually transferred and
wasted till the last aged members of the
band were forced to depend upon the charity
of neighbors and the public.</p>

<p>One of the best accounts of the personality
of Jemima Wilkinson was given by the
Duke de la Rochefoucault Liancourt, who
visited her in 1796. He says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We saw Jemima and attended her meeting,
which is held in her own house. Jemima stood
at the door of her bed chamber on a carpet, with
an armchair behind her. She had on a white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
morning gown and a waistcoat such as men wear
and a petticoat of the same color. Her black
hair was cut short, carefully combed and divided
behind into three ringlets; she wore a stock and
a white silk cravat, which was tied about her neck
with affected negligence. In point of delivery
she preached with more ease than any other
Quaker I have ever heard, but the subject matter
of her discourse was an eternal repetition of the
same subjects—death, sin and repentance. She
is said to be about forty years of age but did
not appear more than thirty. She is of middle
stature, well made, of florid countenance, and
has fine teeth and beautiful eyes. Her action is
studied. She aims at simplicity but is pedantic
in her manner. Her hypocrisy may be traced in
all her discourse, actions and conduct and even
in the very manner which she manages her countenance.</p>
</div>

<p>He speaks with much asperity of her pretence
of condemning earthly enjoyment while
her whole manner of living showed much personal
luxury and gratification.</p>

<p>This description of her was given by one
who saw her:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She was higher than a middle stature, of fine
form, fair complexion with florid cheeks, dark
and brilliant eyes, and beautiful white teeth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
Her hair dark auburn or black, combed from the
seam of the head and fell on her shoulders in
three full ringlets. In her public addresses she
would rise up and stand perfectly still for a minute
or more, than proceed with a slow and distinct
enunciation. She spoke with great ease
and increased fluency; her voice clear and harmonious,
and manner persuasive and emphatic.
Her dress rich but plain and in a style entirely
her own; a broad brimmed beaver hat with a
low crown, and the sides when she rode turned
down and tied under her chin; a full light drab
cloak or mantle and a unique underdress; and a
cravat round the neck with square ends that fell
down to the waist forward.</p>
</div>

<p>The square cravat or band gave her a semi-clerical
look. The rich glossy smoothness
and simplicity of dressing her hair is commented
on by nearly all who left accounts of
her personal appearance; and was doubtless
more marked in her day because the feminine
headdress of that time was elaborate
to a degree that was even fantastic, and was
at the opposite extreme from simple curls.</p>

<p>Many scurrilous and absurd stories are
told of her, especially in a biography of her
which was written and printed soon after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
her death. Many of the anecdotes in this
biography are too petty and too improbable
to be given any credence. I am convinced
that she was a woman of most sober and
discreet life; importunate of respect and
greedy of absolute power; personally luxurious
in her tastes, and of vast ambition, but
always of dignified carriage. And through
her dignity, sobriety, and reserve she had a
lasting hold upon her followers. Perhaps
she told her alleged belief, her tale of her
mission, until she half believed it herself.
One story of her is worthy repetition, and I
think of credence.</p>

<p>It tells of her repulse when she endeavored
to secure among her followers the Indians
of Canandaigua. She spoke to them at
Canandaigua and again at Seneca Lake, evidently
realizing fully the advantage that
might be gained from them through land-grants
and personal support. Many of the
Oneida Indians had been converted by missionaries
to Christianity, and as they held a
Sunday service she entered and made a
thrilling and impressive address, assuring
them she was their Saviour Jesus Christ.
They listened to her with marked attention,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
and one of their number arose and delivered
a short and animated speech to his companions
in the Oneida tongue. When he
ceased speaking, Jemima turned to the interpreter
and asked an explanation of the
speaker’s words, which was given her. The
Indian speaker sat by her side with a sardonic
expression on his grim face, and when
the interpretation was finished, said significantly
and coldly, “You no Jesus Christ—he
know all poor Indian say as well as what
white man say,” and turned contemptuously
from her. It is said that the cunning Indian
detective was the great chief Red
Jacket, and from what we know
of his shrewd and diplomatic
character it can
readily be believed.</p>

<p>Nothing can more plainly show the
regard in which women were held in
Virginia in the middle of the eighteenth
century than the entries in the accounts of
Colonel William Byrd of his visits to Virginia
homes. He was an accomplished and
cultivated gentleman, who wrote with much
intelligence and power when relating his
interviews with men, or discussing what
might be termed masculine subjects, but
who revealed his opinion of the mental capacity
of the fair sex by such side glimpses
as these: “We supped about nine and then
prattled with the ladies.” “Our conversation
with the ladies was like whip-syllabub,
very pretty but nothing in it.” He also
makes rather coarse jokes about Miss Thekky
and her maiden state, which was of course
most deplorable in his and every one else’s
eyes; and he alludes disparagingly to Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
Chiswell as “one of those absolute rarities,
a very good old woman.” The Virginia women
are said by other authors of that day to
have been “bounteous in size and manner.”
M. Droz wrote of them:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Most of the women are quite pretty and insinuating
in their manner if they find you so.
When you ask them if they would like to have
husbands they reply with a good grace that it is
just what they desire.</p>
</div>

<p>For many years an epidemic of sentimentality
and mawkishness seemed to everywhere
prevail in America, and indeed everywhere
among English-speaking peoples, and seemed
also to be universally admired. The women
in America were, as Doctor Shippen wrote,
“languishingly sweet.” This insipidity pervaded
the letters of the times, it showed in
all the diaries and journals that record conversations.
Long and vapid discourses on
love and matrimony and “Platonicks” were
held even between comparative strangers.
Even so sprightly and intelligent a journalist
as Sally Wister records her exceedingly
flippant conversation with young officers of
new acquaintance, who, within a few hours of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
introduction, suggested matrimony and love
and kisses, and punctuated their remarks
with profanity, which they “declared was
their favorite vice.”</p>

<p>William Black, a most observant traveller,
wrote of Philadelphia girls in 1744:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of the ladies began a discourse on love
wherein she pull’d the other Sex to pieces. Setting
forth the Constancy of their Sex and the
Unstability of ours. Every one of the young
ladies put in an Oar and helped her Out; at last
being quite tired of the Subject and at a Loss
what more to say the Lady that begun it turned
from it artfull enough to Criticizing on Plays and
their Authors, Addison, Otway, Prior, Congreve,
Dryden, Pope, Shakespere &amp;c were named often
in Question; the words Genius and no Genius,
Invention, Poetry, Fine things, bad Language,
no Style, Charming writing, Imagary and Diction,
with many more Expressions which swim on the
surface of Criticism seemed to have been caught
by the Female Fishers for the Reputation of Wit.</p>
</div>

<p>Though William Black was willing to talk
of “Love and Platonicks,” and with warm
approval, he was bitter in his rebuke of this
“Fine Lady Mrs Talkative” who dared to
speak of books and authors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>It is well to note the books read by these
young ladies in high life, and their critical
opinion of them. A much-liked book was
named <i>The Generous Inconstant</i>. It has
vanished from our modern view. I should
really like to see the book that rejoiced in
such a title. We can also learn of the books
read by Lucinda the “Young lady of Virginia”
and her friend Polly Brent. Lucinda’s
journal was written during a visit to the
Lees, Washingtons, Grymes, Spotswoods,
and other first families of Virginia, and has
been preserved till our own day. She thus
records:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have spent the morning in reading Lady
Julia Mandeville, and was much affected. Indeed
I think I never cried more in my life reading
a Novel; the Stile is beautiful, but the tale
is horrid. Some one just comes to tell us Mr
Masenbird and Mr Spotswood is come. We
must go down, but I am affraid both Sister’s and
my eyes will betray us.</p>

<p>Mrs. A. Washington has lent me a new Novel
called Victoria. I cant say I admire the Tale,
though I think it prettyly Told. There is a
Verse in it I wish you much to read. I believe
if I ant too Lazy I will copy it off for you; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
verse is not very beautifull but the sense is I
assure you.</p>

<p>I have been very agreeably entertained this
evening reading a Novel called Malvern Dale.
It is something like Evelina, though not so pretty.
I have a piece of advice to give which I have before
urged, that is to read something improving.
Books of instruction will be a thousand times
more pleasing (after a little while) than all the
novels in the World. I own myself I am too
fond of Novel-reading; but by accustoming myself
to reading other Books I have become less
so. I have entertained myself all day reading
Telemachus. It is really delightful and very improving.</p>

<p>I have for the first time in my life just read
Pope’s Eloiza. I had heard my Polly extol it
frequently, and curiosity led me to read it. I will
give you my opinion of it; the Poetry I think
butifull, but do not like some of the sentiments.
Some of Eloizas is too Amorous for a Female I
think.</p>
</div>

<p>Sally Wister, a girl of fifteen, had brought
to her what she called “a charming collection
of books,”—<i>Caroline Melmoth</i>, some
<i>Ladys Magazines</i>, <i>Juliet Grenville</i> and “Joe
Andrews”—this, Fielding’s <i>Joseph Andrews</i>,
I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>The sensible and intelligent Eliza Lucas
wrote in 1742, when she was about twenty-one
years old, with much critical discrimination
on what she read:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I send by the bearer the last volume of Pamela.
She is a good girl and as such I love her dearly,
but I must think her very defective, and even
blush for her while she allows herself that disgusting
liberty of praising herself, or what is very
like it, repeating all the fine speeches made to her
by others,—when a person distinguished for modesty
in every other respect should have chosen
rather to conceal them, or at least let them come
from some other hand; especially as she might
have considered those high compliments might
have proceeded from the partiality of her friends,
or with a view to encourage her and make her
aspire after those qualifications which are ascribed
to her, which I know experimentally to be often
the case. But then you answer, she was a young
country girl, had seen nothing of life, and it was
natural for her to be pleased with praise, and she
had not art enough to conceal it. True, before
she was Mrs. B. it was excusable when only wrote
to her father and mother, but after she had the
advantage of Mr B’s conversation, and others of
sense and distinction, I must be of another opinion.
But here arises a difficulty—we are to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
made acquainted by the author of all particulars;
how then is it to be done? I think by Miss
Durnford or some other lady very intimate with
Mrs B. How you smile at my presumption for
instructing one so far above my own level as the
author of Pamela (whom I esteem much for the
regard he pays to virtue and religion) but contract
your smile into a mortified look for I acquit
the author. He designed to paint no more than
a woman, and he certainly designed it as a reflection
upon the vanity of our sex that a character
so complete in every other instance should be so
defective in this. Defective indeed when she
sometimes mentions that poor creature Mr H’s
applauses it puts me in mind of the observation
in Don Quixote, how grateful is praise even from
a madman.</p>
</div>

<p>A most popular form of literary intercourse
and amusement was everywhere
found in stilted sentimental correspondence,
conducted often under assumed and high-sounding
names, usually classical. For instance,
this young lady of Virginia writes to
her friend, plain Polly, when separated for a
short time:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Oh my Marcia how hard is our fate! that we
should be deprived of your dear company, when
it would compleat our Felecity—but such is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
fate of Mortals! We are never permitted to be
perfectly happy. I suppose it is all right, else
the Supreme Disposer of all things would have
not permitted it, we should perhaps have been
more neglectful than we are of our duty.</p>
</div>

<p>She frequently forgets to use the pompous
name of Marcia, especially when writing
on any subject that really interests
her:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You may depend upon it Polly this said Matrimony
alters us mightily. I am afraid it alienates
us from every one else. It is I fear the ban of
Female Friendship. Let it not be with ours
Polly if we should ever Marry. Farewell my
love, may Heaven shower blessings on your head
prays your Lucinda. (I always forget to make
use of our other name.)</p>
</div>

<p>Even so sensible and intelligent a woman
as Abigail Adams corresponded under the
names Diana or Portia, while her friends
masqueraded as Calliope, Myra, Aspasia, and
Aurelia. Wives wrote to their husbands,
giving them fanciful or classical names.
This of course was no new fashion. Did
not Shakespeare write:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Adoptedly—as school-maids change their name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By vain though apt affection.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>
<p>It is evident that in spite of all the outward
dignity shown in these pompous forms
of address, and in a most ceremonial and reserved
bearing in public, there existed in
private life much rudeness of demeanor and
much freedom in manner. Let me quote
again from the vivacious pages of the young
lady of Virginia:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Gentlemen dined today at Mr Massinbirds.
We have supped, and the gentlemen are not returned
yet. Lucy and myself are in a peck of
troubles for fear they should return drunk. Sister
has had our bed moved in her room. Just
as we were undress’d and going to bed the Gentlemen
arrived, and we had to scamper. Both
tipsy!</p>

<p>Today is Sunday. Brother was so worsted by
the frolick yesterday, we did not set off today.
Mr C. Washington returned today from Fredericksburg.
You cant think how rejoiced Hannah
was, nor how dejected in his absence she always
is. You may depend upon it Polly this said
Matrimony alters us mightely. Hannah and myself
were going to take a long walk this evening
but were prevented by the two Horred Mortals
Mr Pinkard and Mr Washington, who siezed and
kissed me a dozen times in spite of all the resistance
I could make. They really think, now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
they are married, they are prevaliged to do anything....</p>

<p>When we got here we found the house pretty
full. I had to dress in a great hurry for dinner.
We spent the evening very agreeably in chatting.
Milly Washington is a thousand times prettyer
than I thought her at first and very agreeable.
About sunset Nancy, Milly and myself took a
walk in the Garden (it is a most beautiful place).
We were mighty busy cutting thistles to try our
sweethearts, when Mr Washington caught us;
and you cant conceive how he plagued us—chased
us all over the Garden and was quite
impertinent. I must tell you of our frolic after
we went to our room. We took a large dish of
bacon and beef; after that, a bowl of Sago
cream; and after that an apple-pye. While we
were eating the apple-pye in bed—God bless
you, making a great noise—in came Mr Washington
dressed in Hannah’s short gown and peticoat,
and seazed me and kissed me twenty times,
in spite of all the resistance I could make; and
then Cousin Molly. Hannah soon followed
dressed in his Coat. They joined us in eating
the apple-pye and then went out. After this we
took it into our heads to want to eat oysters. We
got up, put on our rappers and went down in the
Seller to get them; do you think Mr Washington
did not follow us and scear us just to death. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
went up tho, and eat our oysters. We slept in
the old ladys room too, and she sat laughing fit
to kill herself at us.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, these were no folk of low degree.
The lively and osculatory Mr. Washington
was Corbin Washington. He married Hannah,
daughter of Richard Henry Lee. Their
grandson, John A. Washington, was the last
of the family to occupy Mount Vernon. Mr.
Pinkard also had a delicate habit of “bolting
in upon us, and overhearing part of our conveasation
in our rooms, which hily delighted
him,” trying to seize the girls’ letters, dressing
in women’s clothes, and other manly and
gentlemanly pleasantries.</p>

<p>Sarah Eve records in her journal an
equally affectionate state of manners in Philadelphian
society in 1722. She writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the morning Dr Shippen came to see us.
What a pity it is that the Doctor is so fond of
kissing. He really would be much more agreeable
if he were less fond. One hates to be
always kissed, especially as it is attended with
so many inconveniences. It decomposes the
economy of ones handkerchief, it disorders ones
high roll, and it ruffles the serenity of ones countenance.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>Though there was great talk made of gallant
and chivalric bearing toward the ladies,
it is evident that occasional rudeness of manner
still existed. A writer in the <i>Royal
Gazette</i> of August 16, 1780, thus complains
of New York swains:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As the Mall seems to be the chief resort for
company of an evening I am surprized that there
is no more politeness and decorum observ’d by
the masculine gender. In short there is seldom
a seat in that agreeable walk that is not taken
up by the gentlemen. This must be very disagreeable
to the fair sex in general whose tender
delicate limbs may be tired with the fatigues
of walking, and bend, denied a seat to rest
them.</p>
</div>

<p>I cannot discover that anything of the
nature of our modern chaperonage was
known in colonial days. We find the early
travellers such as Dunton taking many a
long ride with a fair maid a-pillion back behind
them. In 1750 Captain Francis Goelet
made a trip through New England. He consorted
only with the fashionable folk of the
day, and he appeared to find in them a very
genial and even countrified simplicity of
manners. He tells of riding to “Turtle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
Frolicks” and country dances with young
ladies of refinement and good station in life.
To one of the finer routs at Cambridge he
rode with Miss Betty Wendell in a chaise.
There were twenty couples in all who went
to this Frolick, all, he says complacently, the
“Best Fashion in Boston.” Young men
escorted young girls to dancing-parties, and
also accompanied them home after the dance
was finished.</p>

<p>Weddings were everywhere, throughout
the middle and southern colonies, scenes of
great festivity.</p>

<p>I have been much interested and amused
in reading the <i>Diary of Jacob Hiltzheimer</i>,
of Philadelphia (which has recently been published),
to note his references to the deep
drinking at the weddings of the day. One
entry, on February 14, 1767, runs thus:
“At noon went to William Jones to drink
punch, met several of my friends and got
decently drunk. The groom could not be
accused of the same fault.” This cheerful
frankness reminds us of Sir Walter Raleigh’s
similar ingenuous expression: “Some of our
captains garoused of wine till they were reasonable
pleasant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>This William Jones was married eighteen
years later to a third wife, and again kept
open house, and once more friend Jacob
called on the bride and ate the wedding-cake
and drank the wedding-punch. Nay, more,
he called four days in succession, and at the
end “rode all the afternoon to wear off the
effects of the punch and clear my head.”
At one bride’s house, Mrs. Robert Erwin’s,
record was kept that for two days after the
wedding, between three and four hundred
gentlemen had called, drank punch, and probably
kissed the bride.</p>

<p>It was the universal Philadelphia custom
for the groom’s friends to call thus for two
days at his house and drink punch, and every
evening for a week large tea-parties were
given by the bride, the bridesmaids and
groomsmen always in attendance. Sometimes
a coaching trip was taken by the entire
bridal party out on the Lancaster pike,
for a wedding breakfast.</p>

<p>Similar customs prevailed in New York.
In a letter written by Hannah Thompson I
read of bridal festivities in that town.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Gentlemans Parents keep Open house
just in the same manner as the Brides Parents.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
The Gentlemen go from the Bridegroom house
to drink punch with and give Joy to his Father.
The Brides visitors go in the same manner from
the Brides to her mothers to pay their compliments
to her. There is so much driving about
at these times that in our narrow streets there
is some danger. The Wedding house resembles
a beehive. Company perpetually flying in and
out.</p>
</div>

<p>In a new country, with novel methods of
living, and unusual social relations, there
were some wild and furious wooings. None
were more coarsely extraordinary than the
courting of young Mistress Burwell by the
Governor of the colony of Virginia, an intemperate,
blustering English ruffian named
Nicholson. He demanded her hand in an
Orientally autocratic manner, and when neither
she nor her parents regarded him with
favor, his rage and determination knew no
bounds. He threatened the lives of her
father and mother “with mad furious distracted
speech.” When Parson Fouace
came, meekly riding to visit poor Mr. Burwell,
his parishioner, who was sick (naturally
enough), the Governor set upon him with
words of abuse, pulled the clerical hat off,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
drew his sword, and threatened the clerical
life, until the parson fled in dismay. Fancying
that the brother of Commissary Blair,
the President of the Virginia College, was a
would-be suitor to his desired fair one, he
assailed the President with insane jealousy,
saying, “Sir, your brother is a villain and you
have betrayed me,” and he swore revenge
on the entire family. To annoy further the
good President, he lent his pistols to the
wicked college boys that they might thus
keep the President out of the college buildings.
He vowed if Mistress Burwell married
any one but himself he would cut the
throat of bridegroom, minister, and justice
who issued the marriage license. The noise
of his abuse reached England, and friends
wrote from thence protesting letters to him.
At last the Council united and succeeded in
procuring his removal. Poor President Blair
did not fare well under other governors, and
both College and President were fiercely
hated by Governor Andros; and “a sparkish
young gentleman,” the grandfather of Martha
Washington’s first husband, to show his
zeal for his gubernatorial friend, went into
church and “with great fury and violence”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
pulled Mrs. Blair out of her pew in the face
of the minister and the whole congregation—and
this in the stately old cavalier days.</p>

<p>One very curious duty devolved on young
girls at that day. They often served as
pall-bearers. At the funeral of Mrs. Daniel
Phœnix the pall-bearers were women, and
when Mrs. John Morgan, sister of Francis
Hopkinson, died in Philadelphia, her brother
wrote of her funeral:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The morning was snowy and severely cold,
and the walking very dangerous and slippery,
never the less a number of respectable citizens
attended the funeral and the pall was borne by
the first ladies of the place.</p>
</div>

<p>Sarah Eve, in her diary, writes in 1772, in
a somewhat flippant manner: “R. Rush, P.
Dunn, K. Vaughan, and myself carried Mr.
Ash’s child to be buried; foolish custom for
girls to prance it through the streets without
hats or bonnets!” At the funeral of Fanny
Durdin in 1812, the girl pall-bearers
were dressed in white, and
wore long white
veils.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br><span class="small">THEIR AMUSEMENTS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS.</span></h2></div>


<p>Of amusements for women in the first
century of colonial life, we can almost
say there were none. There was in New
England no card-playing, no theatre-going,
no dancing. The solemn Thursday lecture
was the sole mid-week gathering. Occasionally
there was the excitement of Training
Day. In the South the distances were too
great from plantation to plantation for frequent
friendly meetings. As time went on,
coöperation in gathering and storing the
various food-harvests afforded opportunities
for social intercourse. Apple-parings and
corn-huskings were autumnal delights, but
when these were over, the chafing youth
found no recreations through the long, snowy
months in country homes, and but scant opportunity
for amusement in town. No wonder
that they turned eagerly to the singing-school,
and found in that innocent gathering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
a safety-valve for the pent-up longing for
diversion which burned in young souls then
as now. We can but wonder how, ere the
singing-school became a force, young New
Englanders became acquainted enough with
each other to think of marriage; and we
can almost regard the establishment of the
study of fugue and psalm singing as the
preservation of the commonwealth.</p>

<p>In Virginia the different elements of life
developed characteristic pastimes, and by the
first quarter of the eighteenth century there
were opportunities of diversion offered for
women.</p>

<p>We have preserved to us an exact account
of the sports which were enjoyed by
both Virginian men and women. It may be
found in the <i>Virginia Gazette</i> for October,
1737:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We have advices from Hanover County that
on St Andrews Day there are to be Horse Races
and several other Diversions for the entertainment
of the Gentlemen and Ladies, at the Old
Field, near Captain John Bickertons, in that
County if permitted by the Hon Wm Byrd Esq
Proprietor of said land, the substance of which
is as follows viz:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>It is proposed that 20 Horses or Mares do run
around a three mile course for a prize of five
pounds.</p>

<p>That a Hat of the value of 20s be cudgelled
for, and that after the first challenge made the
Drums are to beat every Quarter of an hour for
three challenges round the Ring and none to
play with their Left hand.</p>

<p>That a violin be played for by 20 Fiddlers; no
person to have the liberty of playing unless he
bring a fiddle with him. After the prize is won
they are all to play together and each a different
tune, and to be treated by the company.</p>

<p>That 12 Boys of 12 years of age do run 112
yards for a hat of the cost of 12 shillings.</p>

<p>That a Flag be flying on said Day 30 feet high.</p>

<p>That a handsome entertainment be provided
for the subscribers and their wives; and such of
them as are not so happy as to have wives may
treat any other lady.</p>

<p>That Drums Trumpets Hautboys &amp;c be provided
to play at said entertainment.</p>

<p>That after Dinner the Royal Health His Honor
the Governor’s &amp;c are to be drunk.</p>

<p>That a Quire of Ballads be sung for by a number
of Songsters, all of them to have liquor sufficient
to clear their Wind Pipes.</p>

<p>That a pair of Silver Buckles be wrestled for
by a number of brisk young men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>That a pair of handsome Shoes be danced for.</p>

<p>That a pair of handsome Silk Stockings of one
Pistole value be given to the handsomest young
country maid that appears in the field.</p>

<p>With many other whimsical and Comical Diversions
too numerous to mention.</p>

<p>And as this mirth is designed to be purely
innocent and void of offence, all persons resorting
there are desired to behave themselves with
decency and sobriety; the subscribers being
resolved to discountenance all immorality with
the utmost rigor.</p>
</div>

<p>There is a certain rough and noisy heartiness
in this rollicking Racing Day in old
Virginia that speaks of boisterous cheer akin
to the days of “merrie England,” and which
seems far from disagreeable when contrasted
with the dull yearly round of sober days in
New England. Virginia and Maryland men
had many social clubs “to promote innocent
mirth and ingenious humour,” but of course
within these clubs their consorts and daughters
were not guests. A ball or a country
dance were the chief amusements of Southern
women, and very smart functions some
of these balls were, though they did begin in
broad daylight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>An early account was given by a travelling
Virginian, William Black, of a Government
Ball in the Council Room at Annapolis
in 1744.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Ladies of Note made a Splendant Appearance.
In a Room Back from where they
Danc’d was Several Sorts of Wines, Punch and
Sweetmeats. In this Room those that was not
engaged in any Dancing Match might better
employ themselves at Cards, Dice, Backgammon,
or with a cheerful Glass. The Ladies were so
very agreeable and seem’d so intent on Dancing
that one might have Imagin’d they had some
Design on the Virginians, either Designing to
make Tryal of their Strength and Vigour, or to
convince them of their Activity and Sprightliness.
After several smart engagements in which
no advantage on either side was Observable, with
a mutual Consent about 1 of the Clock in the
Morning it was agreed to break up, every Gentleman
waiting on his Partner home.</p>
</div>

<p>The method in which a ball was conducted
somewhat more than a century ago
in Louisville was thus told by Maj. Samuel
S. Forman, who visited that town as a young
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After the managers had organized the Company
by drawing numbers and appointing the
opening with a Minuet, Uncle was called on and
introduc’d to a Lady for the opening scene. The
Managers who distributed the numbers called
Gentⁿ No. 1, he takes his stand—Lady No. 1,
she rises from her seat, the Manager leads her
to the floor and introduces Gentⁿ No. 1, &amp; so on
till the floor is full. After all the Company have
been thus call’d out then the Gentⁿ are free to
seek his Partner but no monopoly. Lady at the
head chooses the figure, but it is considered out
of order for one Lady to head a figure twice unless
all have been at the head. If there happen
to be some ladies to whom from mistake or otherwise
have been passed the Managers duty is to
see to it. And another Custom was for a Gentⁿ
to call on a Lady &amp; inform her of an intended
ball &amp; ask permission to see her to the place &amp;
see her safe home again. If the Gentⁿ does not
draw such Lady for the first Contra Dance he
generally engages her for the first Volunteer.
At the Refreshments the Gentⁿ will by instinct
without Chesterfieldian monition see that his
betterhalf (for the time being) has a <i>quantum
sufficit</i> and that without cramming his jaws full
until he has reconducted her to the ball-room,
then he is at liberty to absent himself for a while.
There were two young gentlemen there from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
New York who were much attached to each
other. They promised to let each other know
when a ball was on foot. At one time one came
to the other and told him to prepare his pumps
against such an evening. The answer was—Pumps
out of order, must decline. No Sir that
will not do. Then Sir you have been buying
Several pair of handsome Mocassons for New
York Ladies. If you will lend me one pair &amp;
you will put on one pair (it wont hurt them) I
will go. Snaps his fingers—the very thing. The
next ball after this Moccasons became very fashionable.
So many fashions have their origins
from Necessity.</p>
</div>

<p>A traveller named Bennet gives us an
account of the amusements of Boston women
in the middle of the century, when
dancing was slowly becoming fashionable.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For their domestic amusements every afternoon
after drinking tea, the gentlemen and ladies
walk the Mall, and from there adjourn to one
anothers house to spend the evening, those that
are not disposed to attend the evening lecture
which they may do if they please six nights in the
seven the year round. What they call the Mall
is a walk on a fine green Common adjoining to
the south east side of the town. The Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
being in the hands of dissenters they dont
admit of plays or music houses; but of late they
have sent up an assembly to which some of the
ladies resort. But they are looked upon to be
none of the nicest, in regard to their reputation,
and it is thought it will be soon suppressed for it
is much taken notice of and exploded by the
religious and sober part of the people. But
notwithstanding plays and such like diversions
do not obtain here, they dont be dispirited or
moped for the want of them; for both the ladies
and gentlemen dress and appear as gay in common
as courtiers in England on a coronation or
birthday. And the ladies visit here, drink tea,
indulge in every little piece of gentility to the
height of the mode, and neglect the affairs of
the family with as good a grace as the finest
ladies in London.</p>
</div>

<p>The Marquis de Chastellux writes of the
Philadelphia assembly in 1780:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The assembly or subscription ball, of which I
must give an account may here be introduced.
At Philadelphia, there are places appropriated
for the young people to dance in and where
those whom that amusement does not suit may
play at different games of cards, but at Philadelphia
games of commerce are alone allowed. A
manager or Master of Ceremonies presides at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
the methodical amusements; he presents to the
gentlemen and lady dancers, billets folded up
containing each a number; thus fate decides the
male or female partner for the whole evening.
All the dances are previously arranged and the
dancers are called in their turns. These dances,
like the toasts we drink at table, have some relation
to politics; one is called The Successful
Campaign, another Bourgoynes Defeat, a third
Clintons Retreat. The managers are generally
chosen from among the most distinguished officers
of the army. Colonel Mitchell, a little fat
squat man, was formerly the manager, but when
I saw him he had descended from the magistracy
and danced like a common citizen. He is said
to have exercised his office with great severity,
and it is told of him, that a young lady who was
figuring in a country dance, having forgot her
turn through conversing with a friend, he came
up to her and called out aloud, “Give over, Miss,
take care what you are about. Do you think
you come here for your pleasure?”</p>
</div>

<p>The dance, <i>A Successful Campaign</i>, was
the one selected by diplomatic Miss Peggy
Champlin to open the ball, when she danced
in Newport with General Washington, to the
piping of De Rochambeau and his fellow
officers. This was “the figure” of <i>A Successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
Campaign</i>. “Lead down two couples
on the outside and up the middle; second
couple do the same, turn contrary partners,
cast off, right hand and left.” It was simple,
was it not—but I doubt not it was dignified
and of sedate importance when Washington
footed it.</p>

<p><i>Stony Point</i> was another favorite of Revolutionary
days—for did not General Wayne
successfully storm the place? This dance
was more difficult; the directions were somewhat
bewildering. “First couple three hands
round with the second lady—allemand.
Three hands round with the second gentleman—allemand
again. Lead down two
couples, up again, cast off one couple, hands
round with the third, right and left.” I
scarcely know what the figure “allemand”
was. The German allemande was then an
old style of waltz, slower than the modern
waltz, but I can scarcely think that Washington
or any of those serious, dignified officers
waltzed, even to slow time.</p>

<p>Another obsolete term is “foot it.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Come and foot it as you go</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the light fantastic toe,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>
<p class="p0">seems to refer to some definite step in dancing.
Sheridan in <i>The Rivals</i> thus uses the
term in regard to dances:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I’d foot it with e’er a captain in the county,
but these outlandish heathen allemandes and
cotillions are quite beyond me.</p>
</div>

<p>But “footing it” and “outlandish heathen
allemandes” are not so misty as another
term, “to haze.” In the <i>Innocent Maid</i>
they “hazed.” “First three couples haze,
then lead down the middle and back again,
close with the right hand and left.” In dancing
the <i>Corsino</i> they figured thus: “Three
couples foot it and change sides; foot it
again and once more change sides; three
couples allemand, and the first fall in the
middle then right hand and left.”</p>

<p>Dancing-masters’ advertisements of those
days often give us the list of modish dances:
“Allemandes Vally’s, De la Cours, Devonshire
Minuets and Jiggs.”</p>

<p>Burnaby in 1759 wrote of a special pleasure
of the Quaker maids of Philadelphia: of
fishing-parties.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The women are exceedingly handsome and
polite. They are naturally sprightly and fond of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
pleasure and upon the whole are much more
agreeable and accomplished than the men. Since
their intercourse with the English officers they
are greatly improved, and without flattery, many
of them would not make bad figures even in the
first assemblies in Europe. Their amusements
are chiefly dancing in the winter, and in the
summer forming parties of pleasure upon the
Schuilkill, and in the country. There is a society
of sixteen ladies and as many gentlemen
called The fishing company, who meet once a
fortnight upon the Schuilkill. They have a very
pleasant room erected in a romantic situation
upon the banks of that river where they generally
dine and drink tea. There are several
pretty walks about it, and some wild and rugged
rocks which together with the water and fine
groves that adorn the banks, form a most beautiful
and picturesque scene. There are boats and
fishing tackle of all sorts, and the company
divert themselves with walking, fishing, going up
the water, dancing, singing, conversing, or just
as they please. The ladies wear an uniform and
appear with great ease and advantage from the
neatness and simplicity of it. The first and
most distinguished people of the colony are of
this society; and it is very advantageous to a
stranger to be introduced to it, as he hereby gets
acquainted with the best and most respectable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
company in Philadelphia. In the winter when
there is snow upon the ground it is usual to
make what they call sleighing parties.</p>
</div>

<p>He says of New York society:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The women are handsome and agreeable
though rather more reserved than the Philadelphian
ladies. Their amusements are much the
same as in Pensylvania; viz balls and sleighing
expeditions in the winter, and in the summer
going in parties upon the water and fishing; or
making excursions into the country. There are
several houses pleasantly situated upon East
River near New York where it is common to
have turtle feasts; these happen once or twice
in a week. Thirty or forty gentlemen and ladies
meet and dine together, drink tea in the afternoon,
fish and amuse themselves till evening and
then return home in Italian chaises, a gentleman
and lady in each chaise. In the way there is a
bridge, about three miles distant from New York
which you always pass over as you return, called
the Kissing Bridge where it is a part of the etiquette
to salute the lady who has put herself
under your protection.</p>
</div>

<p>It is evident from these quotations and
from the testimony of other contemporary
authors that one of the chief winter amusements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
in New York and Philadelphia and
neighboring towns was through sleighing-parties.
Madam Knights, of Boston, writing
in 1704 of her visit to New York, said:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Their diversion in winter is riding sleighs
about three or four miles out of town where they
have houses of entertainment at a place called
the Bowery, and some go to friends houses, who
handsomely treat them. Mr. Burroughs carried
his spouse and daughter and myself out to one
Madam Dowes a gentlewoman that lived at a
farmhouse who gave us a handsome entertainment
of five or six dishes and choice beer and
metheglin, etc, all which she said was the produce
of her farm. I believe we met fifty or sixty
sleighs that day; they fly with great swiftness
and some are so furious that they will turn out
of the path for none except a loaded cart.</p>
</div>

<p>There were few sleighs at that date in Boston.</p>

<p>Sixty-four years later, in 1768, a young
English officer, Alexander Macraby, wrote
thus to his brother of the pleasures of sleighing:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You can never have had a party in a sleigh or
sledge I had a very clever one a few days ago.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
Seven sleighs with two ladies and two men in
each proceeded by fiddlers on horseback set out
together upon a snow of about a foot deep on
the roads to a public house, a few miles from town
where we danced, sung, romped and eat and
drank and kicked away care from morning till
night, and finished our frolic in two or three
side-boxes at the play. You can have no idea
of the state of the pulse seated with pretty women
mid-deep in straw, your body armed with furs
and flannels, clear air, bright sunshine, spotless
sky, horses galloping, every feeling turned to joy
and jollity.</p>
</div>

<p>That older members of society then, as
now, did not find sleighing parties altogether
alluring, we learn from this sentence
in a letter of Hannah Thompson written to
John Mifflin in 1786:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This Slaying match Mr Houston of Houston
St gave his Daughters, Dear Papa, Dear Papa,
do give us a slaying—he at last consented, told
them to get ready and dress themselves warm,
which they accordingly did and came running.
We are ready papa. He ordered the Servants to
have some burnt wine against they came back.
He desir’d them to step upstairs with him before
they went. As soon as they got in an Attick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
chamber, he threw up all the windows and
seated them in two old Arm Chairs and began
to whip and Chirrup with all the Spirit of a
Slaying party. And after he kept them long
enough to be sufficiently cold he took them down
and call’d for the Mulled Wine and they were
very glad to set close to the Fire and leave Slaying
for those who were too warm.</p>
</div>

<p>This I quote to execrate the memory of
Mr. Houston and express my sympathy for
his daughters.</p>

<p>There were no entertainments more popular,
from the middle of the past century
to the early years of this one, than “turtle
frolics,” what Burnaby called turtle-feasts.
Every sea-captain who sailed to the West
Indies intended and was expected to bring
home a turtle on the return voyage; and if
he were only to touch at the West Indies
and thence pass on to more distant shores,
he still tried, if possible, to secure a turtle
and send it home by some returning vessel.
In no seaport town did the turtle frolic come
to a higher state of perfection than in Newport.
Scores of turtles were borne to that
welcoming shore. In 1752 George Bresett,
a Newport gentleman, sailed to the West<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
Indies, and promptly did a neighborly and
civic duty by sending home to his friend
Samuel Freebody, a gallant turtle and a
generous keg of limes. Lime juice was the
fashionable and favorite “souring” of the
day, to combine with arrack and Barbadoes
rum into a glorious punch. The turtle arrived
in prime condition, and Freebody
handed the prize over to a slave-body named
Cuffy Cockroach. He was a Guinea Coast
negro, of a race who were (as I have noted
before) the most intelligent of all the Africans
brought as slaves to these shores. Any
negro who acquired a position of dignity or
trust or skill in this country, in colonial days,
was sure to be a Guinea-boy. Cuffy Cockroach
followed the rule, by filling a position
of much dignity and trust and skill—as
turtle-cook. He was a slave of Jaheel Brenton,
but he cooked turtle for the entire
town. The frolic was held at Fort George,
on Goat Island, on December 23. The
guests, fifty ladies and gentlemen, sailed
over in a sloop, and were welcomed with
hoisted flag and salute of cannon. The dinner
was served at two, tea at five, and then
dancing begun. <i>Pea Straw</i>, <i>Faithful Shepherd</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
<i>Arcadian Nuptials</i>, were allemanded
and footed, and the keg of limes and its fellow-ingredients
kept pace with the turtle.
The moon was at the full when the party
landed at the Newport wharf at eleven, but
the frolic was not ended. For instead of
the jolly crowd separating, they went the
rounds, leaving one member of the party at
a time at his own door, and then serenading
him or her, till the whole company had been
honored in succession. When Sammy wrote
to Mr. Bresett he said:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Upon the whole the entertainment had the
preference over all turtle frolics before it, and Mr
George Bresetts health with “Honest George”
was freely drank in a cheerful glass by every person;
and at the request of the company I return
you their compliments for the foundation of so
agreeable an entertainment.</p>
</div>

<p>We find even so staid and dignified a minister
and legislator as Manasseh Cutler writing
thus in Providence in 1787:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This morning I received a polite invitation
from Govenor Bowen in the name of a large company
to join them in a Turtle Frolic about six
miles out of town. Mr Hitchcock and other
clergymen of the town were of the party but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
much against my inclination I was obliged to
excuse myself.</p>
</div>

<p>The traveller who drives through the by-roads
of New England to-day is almost ready
to assert that there is no dwelling too poor
or too lonely to contain a piano, or at the
very least a melodeon or parlor organ. The
sounds of Czerny’s exercises issue from every
farmhouse. There may be no new farm implements,
no sewing-machine, but there will
surely be a piano. This love of music has
ever existed on those rock-bound shores,
though in early days it found a stunted and
sad expression in hymn tunes only, and the
performance of music could scarce be called
a colonial accomplishment. The first musical
instruments were martial, drums and fifes
and hautboys. I have never seen, in any
personal inventory, the notice of a “gitterne”
as in similar Virginian lists.</p>

<p>But in the early years of the eighteenth
century a few spinets must have been exported
to Boston and Philadelphia, and perhaps
to Virginia. In 1712 an advertisement
was placed in the <i>Boston News-Letter</i> that
the Spinet would be taught, and on April 23,
1716, appeared in the same paper:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Note that any Persons may have all Instruments
of Music mended or Virginalls or Spinnets
Strung &amp; Tun’d, at a Reasonable Rate &amp; likewise
may be taught to play on any of the Instruments
above mentioned.</p>
</div>

<p>In August, 1740, a “Good Spinnet” was
offered for sale, and soon after a second-hand
“Spinnet,” and in January, 1750, “Spinnet
wire.”</p>

<p>On September 18, 1769, this notice appeared
in the <i>Boston Gazette and Country
Journal</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is with pleasure that we inform the Public
that a few days since was ship’d for Newport a
very Curious Spinnet being the first ever made
in America, the performance of the ingenious
Mr. John Harris of Boston (son of the late Mr.
Jos. Harris of London, Harpsichord and Spinnet
Maker deceased) and in every respect does honor
to that Artist who now carries on the Business
at his house a few doors Northward of Dr.
Clarkes, North End of Boston.</p>
</div>

<p>This first American spinet is said to be
still in existence in a house in Newport on
the corner of Thames and Gidley streets.
It has one set of jacks and strings. The
hammers have crow-quills which press on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
brass strings. It has ancient neighbors. In
Bristol, R. I., is a triangular spinet four feet
long, which is more than a century older than
the town which is now its home. It bears
this maker’s mark,—“Johann Hitchcock
fecit London 1520.” If this date is correct,
it is the oldest spinet known, the one of
Italian manufacture in the British Museum
being dated 1521.</p>

<p>At the rooms of the Essex Institute in
Salem, Mass., is an old spinet made by Dr.
Samuel Blyth in that town. Henry M.
Brooks, Esq., author of <i>Olden Time Music</i>,
has in his possession a bill for one of these
American spinets that shows that the price
in 1786 was £18. In the Memorial Hall at
Deerfield, Mass., may be seen another dilapidated
one, made by Stephanus &amp; Keene.
This belonged once to Mrs. Sukey Barker, of
Hingham.</p>

<p>In the <i>Newport Mercury</i> of May 17, 1773,
is advertised, “To be sold a Spinnet of a
proper size for a little miss, and a most agreeable
tone—plays extremely easy on the keys.
Inquire of the Printer.” Advertisement of
the sale of spinets and of instruction on the
spinet do not disappear from the newspapers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
in this country even after formidable rivals
and successors, the harpsichord and forte-piano,
had begun to be imported in comparatively
large numbers.</p>

<p>The tone of a spinet has been characterized
concisely by Holmes in his poem, <i>The
Opening of the Piano</i>,—the “spinet with its
thin metallic thrills.” I know of nothing
more truly the “relic of things that have
passed away,” more completely the voice of
the past, than the tinkling thrill of a spinet.
It is like seeing a ghost to touch the keys,
and bring forth once more that obsolete
sound. There is no sound born in the nineteenth
century that at all resembles it. Like
“loggerheads” in the coals and “lug-poles”
in the chimney, like church lotteries and tithingmen,
the spinet—even its very voice—is
extinct.</p>

<p>Since in the <i>News-Letter</i> first quoted in
this chapter virginals are named, I think the
musical instrument of Queen Elizabeth must
have been tolerably familiar to Bostonians.
Judge Sewall, who “had a passion for music,”
writes in 1690 of fetching his wife’s “virginalls.”
I cannot conceive what tunes
Madam Sewall played on her virginals, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
tawdry ballads and roundelays, no minuets
and corams; she may have known half a
dozen long-metre psalm tunes such as the
Judge set for so many years in meeting.</p>

<p>“Forte-pianers” were imported to America,
as were other musical instruments. It
is said the first one brought to New England
was in 1785 by John Brown for his daughter
Sarah, afterwards Mrs. Herreshoff. It is
still possessed by Miss Herreshoff, of Bristol,
R. I. The first brought to “the Cape” was
a Clementi of the date 1790, and found for
many years a home in Falmouth. It is in
perfect preservation, a dainty little inlaid box
lying upon a slender low table, with tiny
shelves for the music books, and a tiny little
painted rack to hold the music sheets, and a
pedal fit for the foot of a doll. It is now
owned by Miss Frances Morse, of Worcester,
Mass. An old Broadwood piano, once owned
by the venerable Dr. Sweetser, may be seen
at the rooms of the Worcester Society of
Antiquity; and still another, a Clementi, at
the Essex Institute in Salem.</p>

<p>By the beginning of this century piano-playing
became a more common accomplishment,
especially in the large towns, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
General Oliver said that in 1810, among the
six thousand families in Boston, there were
not fifty pianos. Rev. Manasseh Cutler
writes in 1801, from Washington, of a young
friend:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She has been educated at the best schools in
Baltimore and Alexandria. She does not converse
much, but is very modest and agreeable.
She plays with great skill on the Forte Piano
which she always accompanies with the most
delightful voice, and is frequently joined in the
vocal part by her mother. Mr. King has an excellent
Forte-Piano which is connected with an
organ placed under it, which she plays and fills
with her feet, while her fingers are employed upon
the Forte-Piano. On Sunday evenings she constantly
plays Psalm music. Miss Anna plays
Denmark remarkably well. But the most of the
psalm tunes our gentlemen prefer are the old
ones such as Old Hundred, Canterbury, which
you would be delighted to hear on the Forte-Piano
assisted by the Organ. Miss Anna gave
us some good music this evening, particularly the
Wayworn Traveller, Ma Chere Amie, The Tea,
The Twins of Latma (somewhat similar to Indian
Chief) Eliza, Lucy or Selims Complaint. These
are among my favourites.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>In February, 1800, Eliza Southgate Bowne
wrote thus in Boston:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the morning I am going to look at some
Instruments; however we got one picked out that
I imagine we shall take, 150 dollars, a charming
toned one and not made in this country.</p>
</div>

<p>In June she said enthusiastically of her
“Instrument:”—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am learning my 12th tune Oh Octavia, I
almost worship my Instrument,—it reciprocates
my joys and sorrows, and is my bosom companion.
How I long to have you return! I have
hardly attempted to sing since you went away.
I am sure I shall not dare to when you return.
I must enjoy my triumph while you are absent;
my musical talents will be dim when compared
with the lustre of yours.</p>
</div>

<p>The most universal accomplishment of
colonial women was the making of samplers,
if, indeed, anything could be termed an accomplishment
which was so rigidly and prosaically
part of their education. I can well
imagine the disgrace it would have been to
any little miss in her teens a century ago not
to be able to show a carefully designed and
wrought sampler. On these samplers were
displayed the alphabet, sometimes in various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
shaped letters—thus did she learn to mark
neatly her household linen; bands of conventional
designs, of flowers, of geometrical patterns—thus
was she taught to embroider
muslin caps and kerchiefs; and there were
gorgeous flowers and strange buildings, and
domestic scenes, and pastoral views, birds
that perched as large as cows, and roses that
were larger than either; and last and best of
all (and often of much satisfaction to the
genealogist), there was her name and her age,
and sometimes her place of birth, and withal
a pious verse as a motto for this housewifely
shield. Of all the relics of old-time life
which have come to us, none are more interesting
than the samplers. Happily, many of
them <i>have</i> come to us; worked with wiry
enduring crewels and silk on strong linen
canvas, they speak down through the century
of the little, useful, willing hands that
worked them; of the tidy sempstresses and
housewives of those simple domestic days.
We know little of the daughters of the Pilgrims,
but Lora Standish has sent to us a
prim little message of her piety, and a faded
testimony of her skill, that makes her seem
dear to us:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">As will conduce to Virtue void of Shame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I will give the Glory to Thy Name.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A more ambitious kind of needlework took
the form of what were known as mourning
pieces. These were regarded with deepest
affection, for were they not a token of loving
remembrance? They bore stiff presentments
of funeral urns, with drooping willows,
or a monument with a bowed and weeping
figure. Often the names of dead members
of the family were worked upon the monument.
A still more ambitious sampler bore
a design known as The Tree of Life. A
stiffly branched tree was sparingly hung with
apples labelled with the names of the virtues
of humanity, such as Love, Honor, Truth,
Modesty, Silence. A white-winged angel on
one side of this tree watered the roots with
a very realistic watering-pot, and was balanced
with exactness, as were evenly adjusted
all good embroidery designs of that day, by
an inky-black Satan who bore a pitchfork of
colossal proportions and a tail as long as a
kite’s, and so heavy that he could scarce have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
dragged it along the ground—much less with
it have flown.</p>

<p>For many years a favorite and much
praised accomplishment was the cutting of
paper in ornamental designs. This art was
ambitiously called Papyrotamia, and it was of
special usefulness in its application to watch-papers,
a favorite lover’s token of the day.
The watch proper at that time was separate
and removable from its case, which was of
gold, silver, shagreen, or lacquer. Of course
the watch did not fit closely into the case,
and watch-papers were placed within to serve
as a cushion to prevent jar and wear; sometimes
the case would hold several. Artistic
and grotesque taste could be used in the
manufacture of these tokens of regard. I
have seen them cut in various open-work designs
from gilt and silver paper, embroidered
in hair, painted in water colors. One I have
has two turtle-doves billing over two hearts,
and surrounded by a tiny wreath; another,
embroidered on net, has the words “God is
Love;” another has a moss rose and the
words “Rejoice and blossom as a rose.” Another
bears a funeral urn, and is evidently <i>in
memoriam</i>. Still another, a heart and arrows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
and the sentimental legend “Kill me for I die
of love.” Jefferson, writing as a young man,
bitterly deplores his inadvertent tearing of
watch-papers which had been cut for him by
his beloved Belinda. Watch and watch-papers
had been accidentally soaked in water,
and when he attempted to remove the papers,
he says, “My cursed fingers gave them
such a rent as I fear I shall never get over.
I would have cried bitterly, but that I
thought it beneath the dignity of a man.”
And he trusts the fair Becca will give him
another paper of her cutting, which, though
but a plain round one, he will esteem more
than the nicest in the world cut by other
hands.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more pathetic than the
thoughtful survey of the crude and often
cumbersome and ludicrous attempts at decorative
art, through which the stunted and
cramped love of the beautiful found expression,
until our own day, in country homes.
The dreary succession of hair-work, feather-work,
wax flowers, shell-work, the crystallization
with various domestic minerals and gums
of dried leaves and grasses, vied with yarn
and worsted monstrosities, and bewildering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
patchwork. Occasionally some bold feminine
spirit, made inventive through artistic
longing, gave birth to a novel, though too
often grotesque form of decoration.</p>

<p>A most interesting symbol of exquisite
neatness, unbounded patience, and blind
groping for artistic expression was Rhoda
Baker’s “Leather-Works.” Rhoda Baker
lived in a small Rhode Island village, which
was dull at its birth and slow of growth and
progress. She had a nature so timid, so
repelling, and so wholly introspective, that,
after nearly fifty years of shy and even unwilling
“keeping company” with a preaching
elder of the time,—a saint, almost a
mystic,—she died without ever having given
to the quaint, thin, pleasant-faced, awkward
man, one word of encouragement to his equally
timid, his hinting and halting love-making.
During those patient years of warm hopes,
but most scanty fruition, he had built a
house on an island which he owned in Narragansett
Bay, with a window where his beloved
Rhoda could sit sewing when she became
his wife, and watch him happily rowing
across the Bay to her; but great lilac bushes
grew up unchecked, and shaded and finally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
hid the window at which Rhoda never sat to
welcome her husband-lover. After her death
the Elder so grieved that he had naught to
remind him and speak to him of his beloved,
that he boldly decided to name his boat for
her; but as he could not conscientiously say
she had ever encouraged him by word or
look in his incipient love-making, and he
must be strictly honest and chivalrously respectful
to her memory, he painted upon
the boat in black letters this truthful yet
dimly consoling legend, “Rhoda Wouldnt.”
Poor Elder! Many a time had he ventured
a-courting, and slowly entering, after his unanswered
assault upon the door-knocker, had
found the kitchen of this elusive Rhoda vacant,—<i>but
her rocking-chair was slowly rocking</i>,—so
he sadly left the deserted room, the
unwelcoming house.</p>

<p>He sacrificed his life to his affection for
his dead love. He had all his days a fear,
a premonition, that he should lose his life
through a horse, so he never rode or drove,
but walked, rowed, or sailed, and lived on an
island to escape his dreaded doom. When
Rhoda’s brother died in a distant town, the
Elder was bidden to the funeral, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
honored his Rhoda’s memory by his attendance,
and he had to ride there. As he left
the house of mourning, a fractious young
colt ran away with him, threw him out of the
wagon, and broke his neck.</p>

<p>His sweetheart’s “Leather-Works” still
exist, to keep fresh this New England
romance. I saw them last summer in the
attic of the Town Hall. Rhoda left them in
her will to her church, and they are now the
property of the village church-guild. The
guild is vigorous and young, so can bear this
ancient maiden’s bequest with cheerful carriage
and undaunted spirits. The leather-works
are many and ponderous. One is
a vast trellis (which may have been originally
two clothes-horses), hung with elaborately
twisted and tendrilled vines, bearing
minutely veined leaves and various counterfeit
and imaginary fruits. The bunches of
grapes are made of home-cast leaden bullets,
or round stones, covered dexterously
and with unparalleled neatness and imperceptible
stitches with pieces of old kid gloves
or thin leather; and to each a common dress-hook
is attached. The stem of the bunch
has corresponding eyes, to each of which a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
grape is hung. By this ingenious means
the bunches of grapes could be neatly dusted
each week, and kept in repair, as well as easily
shaped. On this trellis hung also Roses
of Sharon, a mystic flower which Rhoda’s
sister Eunice invented, and which had a
deep spiritual signification, as well as extraordinary
outline and intricate composition.
Every leaf, every grape, every monstrous
fruit, every flower of these Leather-Works,
speaks of the æsthetic longing, the vague
mysticism, the stifled repression, of Rhoda
Baker’s life; and they speak equally of the
Elder’s love. It was he who moulded the
bullets, and searched on the shore for carefully
rounded stones; and he who haunted
the country saddlers and repair-shops for
waste strips of leather, which he often deposited
in the silent kitchen by the rocking-chair,
sure of grateful though unspoken
thanks. Many a pair of his old boot-tops
figures as glorious vine leaves; and he
even tanned and dressed skins to supply
swiftly the artist’s materials when genius
burned. It was he who tenderly unhooked
the grapes and pears, the fruits of Eden and
the Roses of Sharon, when the trellis was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
transported to the Town Hall, and he reverently
placed the trophies of his true love’s
skill and genius in place in their new home.
I always rather resent the fact that Rhoda
did not bequeath the Leather-Works to him,
when I think of the vast and almost sacred
pleasure he would have had in them; as well
as when I remember the share he had in the
preparations for their manufacture. And the
Leather-Works speak still another lesson,
as do many of the household grotesqueries
seen in New England, a lesson of sympathy,
almost of beauty, to those who “read
between the lines, the finer
grace of unfulfilled
designs.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br><span class="small">DAUGHTERS OF LIBERTY.</span></h2></div>


<p>We are constantly hearing the statement
reiterated, that the Society of the
Daughters of the American Revolution was
the first association of women ever formed
for patriotic purpose. This assertion shows
a lamentable ignorance of Revolutionary history;
for a century and a quarter ago, before
the War of the Revolution, patriotic
societies of women were formed all over the
country, and called Daughters of Liberty.
Our modern bands should be distinguished
by being called the first patriotic-hereditary
societies of women.</p>

<p>As we approach Revolutionary days, it is
evident that the women of all the colonies
were as deeply stirred as were the men at
the constant injustice and growing tyranny
of the British government, and they were
not slow in openly averring their abhorrence
and revolt against this injustice. Their individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
action consisted in the wearing only
of garments of homespun manufacture; their
concerted exertions in gathering in patriotic
bands to spin, and the signing of compacts
to drink no more of the taxed tea, that significant
emblem of British injustice and
American revolt.</p>

<p>The earliest definite notice of any gathering
of Daughters of Liberty was in Providence
in 1766, when seventeen young ladies
met at the house of Deacon Ephraim Bowen
and spun all day long for the public benefit,
and assumed the name Daughters of Liberty.
The next meeting the little band had
so increased in numbers that it had to meet
in the Court House. At about the same
time another band of daughters gathered at
Newport, and an old list of the members has
been preserved. It comprised all the beautiful
and brilliant young girls for which Newport
was at that time so celebrated. As one
result of this patriotic interest, the President
and the first graduating class of Brown University,
then called Rhode Island College,
were clothed, at Commencement in 1769, in
fabrics of American homespun manufacture.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
The senior class of the previous year at
Harvard had been similarly dressed.</p>

<p>These little bands of patriotic women
gathered far and wide throughout New England.
At one meeting seventy linen wheels
were employed. In Newbury, Beverly, Rowley,
Ipswich, spinning matches were held.
Let me show how the day was spent. I
quote from the <i>Boston News-Letter</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Rowley. A number of thirty-three respectable
ladies of the town met at sunrise [this was in
July] with their wheels to spend the day at the
house of the Rev’d Jedidiah Jewell in the laudable
design of a spinning match. At an hour before
sunset, the ladies then appearing neatly
dressed, principally in homespun, a polite and
generous repast of American production was set
for their entertainment, after which being present
many spectators of both sexes, Mr. Jewell
delivered a profitable discourse from Romans
xii. 2: Not slothful in business, fervent in spirit,
serving the Lord.</p>
</div>

<p>You will never find matters of church and
patriotism very far apart in New England;
so I learn that when they met in Ipswich
the Daughters of Liberty were also entertained
with a sermon. The Newbury patriots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
drank Liberty Tea, and listened to a
sermon on the text Proverbs xxxi. 19. Another
text used at one of these gatherings
was from Exodus xxxv. 25: “And all the
women that were wise-hearted did spin with
their hands.”</p>

<p>The women of Virginia were early in the
patriotic impulses, yet few proofs of their
action or determination remain. In a Northern
paper, the <i>Boston Evening Post</i> of January
31, 1770, we read this Toast to the
Southerners:—</p>


<p class="center">NEW TOASTS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The patriotic ladies of Virginia, who have
nobly distinguished themselves by appearing in
the Manufactures of America, and may those of
the Massachusetts be laudably ambitious of not
being outdone by Virginians.</p>

<p>The wise and virtuous part of the Fair Sex in
Boston and other Towns, who being at length
sensible that by the consumption of Teas they
are supporting the Commissioners &amp; other Tools
of Power, have voluntarily agreed not to give or
receive any further Entertainments of that Kind,
until those Creatures, together with the Boston
Standing Army, are removed, and the Revenue
Acts repealed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>May the disgrace which a late venal &amp; corrupt
Assembly has brought upon a Sister Colony,
be wiped away by a Dissolution.</p>
</div>

<p>This is pretty plain language, but it could
not be strange to the public ear, for ere this
Boston women had been appealed to in the
press upon this same subject.</p>

<p>In the <i>Massachusetts Gazette</i>, as early as
November 9, 1767, these lines show the indignant
and revolutionary spirit of the time:</p>

<p>Soon these frequent appeals, and the influence
of the public and earnest revolt of
the Sons of Liberty, resulted in a public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
compact of Boston women. It is thus recorded
in the Boston press:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <i>Boston Evening Post</i>:—</p>

<p>
Monday, February 12, 1770.<br>
</p>

<p>The following agreement has lately been come
into by upwards of 300 Mistresses of Families in
this Town; in which Number the Ladies of the
highest rank and Influence, that could be waited
upon in so short a Time, are included.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, January 31, 1770.<br>
</p>

<p>At a time when our invaluable Rights and
Privileges are attacked in an unconstitutional
and most alarming Manner, and as we find we
are reproached for not being so ready as could
be desired, to lend our Assistance, we think it
our Duty perfectly to concur with the true
Friends of Liberty in all Measures they have
taken to save this abused Country from Ruin
and Slavery. And particularly, we join with the
very respectable Body of Merchants and other
Inhabitants of this Town, who met in Faneuil
Hall the 23d of this Instant, in their Resolutions,
totally to abstain from the Use of Tea; And as
the greatest Part of the Revenue arising by Virtue
of the late Acts, is produced from the Duty
paid upon Tea, which Revenue is wholly expended
to support the American Board of Commissioners;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
We, the Subscribers, do strictly engage,
that we will totally abstain from the Use of
that Article, (Sickness excepted) not only in our
respective Families, but that we will absolutely
refuse it, if it should be offered to us upon any
Occasion whatsoever. This Agreement we cheerfully
come into, as we believe the very distressed
Situation of our Country requires it, and we do
hereby oblige ourselves religiously to observe it,
till the late Revenue Acts are repealed.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Massachusetts Gazette</i>, and the <i>Boston
Weekly News-Letter</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
February 15, 1770.<br>
</p>

<p>We hear that a large Number of the Mistresses
of Families, some of whom are Ladies of the
highest Rank, in this Town, have signed an
Agreement against drinking Tea (Bohea it is
supposed, tho’ not specified); they engage not
only to abstain from it in their Families (Sickness
excepted) but will absolutely refuse it, if it
should be offered to them upon any Occasion;
This Agreement to be religiously observed till
the Revenue Acts are repealed.</p>
</div>

<p>It was natural that, in that hotbed of rebellion,
young girls should not be behind
their brothers, fathers, and their mothers in
open avowal of their revolt. Soon the young
ladies published this declaration:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We, the daughters of those patriots who have
and do now appear for the public interest, and
in that principally regard their posterity—as
such, do with pleasure engage with them in denying
ourselves the drinking of foreign tea in hopes
to frustrate a plan which tends to deprive the
whole community of all that is valuable as life.</p>
</div>

<p>One dame thus declared her principles and
motives in blank verse:—</p>

<p>When little Anna Green Winslow bought
a hat in February, 1771, she bought one of
“white holland with the feathers sewed on
in a most curious manner, white and unsulleyed
as the falling snow. As I am as we
say a daughter of Liberty I chuse to wear
as much of our own manufactory as posible.”</p>

<p>Mercy Warren wrote to John Winthrop, in
fine satire upon this determination of American
women to give up all imports from Great
Britain except the necessaries of life, a list
of the articles a woman would deem it imperative
to retain:—</p>

</div>

<p>After the war had really begun, Mrs. John
Adams, writing July 31, 1777, tells of an
astonishing action of Boston women, plainly
the result of all these revolutionary tea-notions:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is a great scarcity of sugar and coffee,
articles which the female part of the State is very
loath to give up, especially whilst they consider
the scarcity occasioned by the merchants having
secreted a large quantity. There had been much
rout and noise in the town for several weeks.
Some stores had been opened by a number of
people, and the coffee and sugar carried into the
market and dealt out by pounds. It was rumored
that an eminent stingy wealthy merchant (who is
a bachelor) had a hogshead of coffee in his store<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
which he refused to sell the committee under six
shillings per pound. A number of females, some
say a hundred, some say more, assembled with a
cart and trunks, marched down to the warehouse
and demanded the keys which he refused to deliver.
Upon which one of them seized him by
his neck and tossed him into the cart. Upon
his finding no quarter, he delivered the keys
when they tipped up the cart and discharged
him; then opened the warehouse, hoisted out
the coffee themselves, put into the trunks, and
drove off. It was reported that he had personal
chastisements among them, but this I believe
was not true. A large concourse of men stood
amazed, silent spectators of the whole transaction.</p>
</div>

<p>I suppose these Boston dames thought
they might have coffee since they could not
have tea; and, indeed, the relative use of
these two articles in America was much
changed by the Revolution. To this day
much more coffee is drunk in America, proportionately,
than in England. We are not
a tea-drinking nation.</p>

<p>I don’t know that there were Daughters
of Liberty in Philadelphia, but Philadelphia
women were just as patriotic as those of other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
towns. One wrote to a British officer as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have retrenched every superfluous expense
in my table and family. Tea I have not drunk
since last Christmas, nor have I bought a cap or
gown since your defeat at Lexington. I have
learned to knit and am now making stockings
of wool for my servants. In this way do I now
throw in my mite for public good. I know this,
that as free I can die but once, but as a slave I
shall not be worthy of life. I have the pleasure
to assure you that these are the sentiments of my
sister Americans.</p>
</div>

<p>The women of the South were fired with
patriotism; in Mecklenburgh and Rowan
counties, North Carolina, Daughters of Liberty
found another method of spurring patriotism.
Young ladies of the most respectable
families banded together, and pledged
themselves not to receive addresses from any
recreant suitors who had not obeyed the country’s
call for military service.</p>

<p>There was an historic tea-party also in that
town of so much importance in those days—Edenton,
N. C. On October 25, 1774, fifty-one
spirited dames assembled at the residence
of Mrs. Elizabeth King, and passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
resolutions commending the action of the
Provincial Congress, and declared also that
they would not conform to “that Pernicious
Custom of Drinking Tea or that the aforesaid
Ladys would not promote ye wear of any
manufacture from England,” until the tax
was repealed.</p>

<p>The notice of the association is contained
in the American Archives, and runs thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Association Signed by Ladies of Edenton,
North Carolina, Oct. 25, 1774. As we cannot be
indifferent on any occasion that appears to affect
the peace and happiness of our country, and as
it has been thought necessary for the publick
good to enter into several particular resolves, by
meeting of Members of Deputies from the whole
Province, it is a duty that we owe not only to our
near and dear relations and connections, but to
ourselves who are essentially interested in their
welfare, to do everything as far as lies in our
power to testify our sincere adherence to the
same, and we do therefore accordingly subscribe
this paper as a witness of our fixed intentions and
solemn determination to do so. Signed by fifty
one ladies.</p>
</div>

<p>It is a good example of the strange notions
which some historians have of the slight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
value of circumstantial evidence in history,
that the names of these fifty-one ladies have
not been preserved. A few, however, are
known. The president was Mrs. Penelope
Barker, who was thrice a widow, of husbands
Hodgson, Crumm, and Barker. She was
high-spirited, and from her varied matrimonial
experiences knew that it was needless
to be afraid of any man; so when British
soldiers invaded her stables to seize her carriage
horses, she snatched the sword of one
of her husbands from the wall, with a single
blow severed the reins in the British officer’s
hands, and drove her horses back into the
stables, and kept them too.</p>

<p>The fame of this Southern tea-party
reached England, for Arthur Iredell wrote
(with the usual masculine jocularity upon
feminine enterprises) thus, on January 31,
1775, from London to his patriot brother,
James Iredell:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I see by the newspapers the Edenton ladies
have signalized themselves by their protest
against tea-drinking. The name of Johnston I
see among others; are any of my sister’s relations
patriotic heroines? Is there a female Congress
at Edenton too? I hope not, for we Englishmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
are afraid of the male Congress, but if
the ladies who have ever, since the Amazonian
era, been esteemed the most formidable enemies,
if they, I say, should attack us, the most fatal
consequence is to be dreaded. So dextrous in
the handling of a dart, each wound they give is
mortal; whilst we, so unhappily formed by Nature,
the more we strive to conquer them the more
are conquered! The Edenton ladies, conscious
I suppose of this superiority on their side, by
former experience, are willing, I imagine, to crush
us into atoms by their omnipotency; the only
security on our side to prevent the impending
ruin that I can perceive is the probability that
there are few places in America which possess
so much female artillery as in Edenton.</p>
</div>

<p>Another indication of the fame of the
Edenton tea-party is adduced by Dr. Richard
Dillard in his interesting magazine paper
thereon. It was rendered more public by a
caricature, printed in London, a mezzotint,
entitled “A Society of Patriotic Ladies at
Edenton in North Carolina.” One lady with
a gavel is evidently a man in woman’s clothing,
and is probably intended for the hated
Lord North; other figures are pouring the
tea out of caddies, others are writing. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
caricature may have been brought forth in
derision of an interesting tea-party picture
which still exists, and is in North Carolina,
after some strange vicissitudes in a foreign
land. It is painted on glass, and the various
figures are doubtless portraits of the Edenton
ladies.</p>

<p>It is difficult to-day to be wholly sensible
of all that these Liberty Bands meant
to the women of the day. There were not,
at that time, the associations of women for
concerted charitable and philanthropic work
which are so universal now. There were
few established and organized assemblies of
women for church work (there had been some
praying-meetings in Whitefield’s day), and
the very thought of a woman’s society for
any other than religious purposes must have
been in itself revolutionary. And we scarcely
appreciate all it meant for them to abandon
the use of tea; for tea-drinking in that day
meant far more to women than it does now.
Substitutes for the taxed and abandoned exotic
herb were eagerly sought and speedily
offered. Liberty Tea, Labrador Tea, and
Yeopon were the most universally accepted,
though seventeen different herbs and beans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
were named by one author; and patriotic
prophecies were made that their use would
wholly outlive that of the Oriental drink,
even could the latter be freely obtained.
A century has proved the value of these
prophecies.</p>

<p>Liberty Tea was the most popular of these
Revolutionary substitutes. It sold for sixpence
a pound. It was made from the four-leaved
loose-strife, a common-growing herb.
It was pulled up whole like flax, its stalks
were stripped of the leaves and then boiled.
The leaves were put in a kettle with the
liquor from the stalks and again boiled.
Then the leaves were dried in an oven.
Sage and rib-wort, strawberry leaves and

Hyperion or Labrador Tea, much vaunted,
was only raspberry leaves, but was not such
a wholly odious beverage. It was loudly
praised in the patriotic public press:—</p>

<p>The use of Hyperion or Labrador tea is every

The virtues of the plant or shrub from which
this delicate Tea is gathered were first discovered
by the Aborigines, and from them the Canadians
learned them. Before the cession of Canada to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
Great Britain we knew little or nothing of this
most excellent herb, but since we have been
taught to find it growing all over hill and dale

New England in great plenty and that
of best quality, particularly on the
banks of the Penobscot, Kennebec,
Nichewannock and
Merrimac.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br><span class="small">A REVOLUTIONARY HOUSEWIFE.</span></h2></div>


<p>We do not need to make a composite
picture of the housewife of Revolutionary
days, for a very distinct account has
been preserved of one in the quaint pages of
the <i>Remembrancer</i> or diary of Christopher
Marshall, a well-to-do Quaker of Philadelphia,
who was one of the Committee of Observation
of that city during the Revolutionary
War. After many entries through the
year 1778, which incidentally show the many
cares of his faithful wife, and her fulfilment
of these cares, the fortunate husband thus
bursts forth in her praise:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As I have in this memorandum taken scarcely
any notice of my wife’s employments, it might
appear as if her engagements were very trifling;
the which is not the case but the reverse. And
to do her justice which her services deserved, by
entering them minutely, would take up most of
my time, for this genuine reason, how that from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
early in the morning till late at night she is constantly
employed in the affairs of the family,
which for four months has been very large; for
besides the addition to our family in the house,
it is a constant resort of comers and goers which
seldom go away with dry lips and hungry bellies.
This calls for her constant attendance, not only
to provide, but also to attend at getting prepared
in the kitchen, baking our bread and pies, meat
&amp;c. and also the table. Her cleanliness about
the house, her attendance in the orchard, cutting
and drying apples of which several bushels have
been procured; add to which her making of
cider without tools, for the constant drink of the
family, her seeing all our washing done, and her
fine clothes and my shirts, the which are all
smoothed by her; add to this, her making of
twenty large cheeses, and that from one cow,
and daily using with milk and cream, besides
her sewing, knitting &amp;c. Thus she looketh well
to the ways of her household, and eateth not the
bread of idleness; yea she also stretcheth out
her hand, and she reacheth forth her hand to
her needy friends and neighbors. I think she
has not been above four times since her residence
here to visit her neighbors; nor through
mercy has she been sick for any time, but has at
all times been ready in any affliction to me or my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
family as a faithful nurse and attendant both
day and night.</p>
</div>

<p>Such laudatory references to the goodwife
as these abound through the <i>Remembrancer</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My tender wife keeps busily engaged and
looks upon every Philadelphian who comes to
us as a person suffering in a righteous cause;
and entitled to partake of her hospitality which
she administers with her labor and attendance
with great freedom and alacrity....</p>

<p>My dear wife meets little respite all the day,
the proverb being verified, that Woman’s Work
is never done.</p>

<p>I owe my health to the vigilance, industry and
care of my wife who really has been and is a
blessing unto me. For the constant assiduity
and press of her daily and painful labor in the
kitchen, the Great Lord of the Household will
reward her in due time.</p>
</div>

<p>It seems that so generous and noble a woman
should have had a reward in this world,
as well as the next, for, besides her kitchen
duties, she was a “nonsuch gardner, working
bravely in her garden,” and a first class
butter-maker, who constantly supplied her
poor neighbors with milk, and yet always
had cream to spare for her dairy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>Far be it from me to cast even the slightest
reflection, to express the vaguest doubt,
as to the industry, energy, and application of
so pious, so estimable an old gentleman as
Mr. Marshall, but he was, as he says, “easily
tired”—“the little I do tires and fatigues
me”—“the grasshopper seems a burden.”
So, even to our prosaic and somewhat emancipated
nineteenth century notions as to
women’s rights and their assumption of
men’s duties, it does appear that so patient,
industrious, and overworked a consort might
have been spared some of the burdensome
duties which devolved upon her, and which
are popularly supposed not to belong to the
distaff side of the house. An elderly milk-man
might have occasionally milked the
cow for that elderly weary milkmaid. And
it does seem just a little strange that a
hearty old fellow, who could eat gammons
and drink punch at every occasion of sober
enjoyment and innocent revelry to which he
was invited, should let his aged spouse rise
at daybreak and go to the wharves to buy
loads of wood from the bargemen; and also
complacently record that the horse would
have died had not the ever-energetic wife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
gone out and by dint of hard work and good
management succeeded in buying in the
barren city a load of hay for provender.
However, he never fails to do her justice in
commendatory words in the pages of his
<i>Remembrancer</i>, thus proving himself more
thoughtful than that Yankee husband who
said to a neighbor that his wife was such a
good worker and a good cook, and so pleasant
and kept everything so neat and nice
around the house, that sometimes it seemed
as if he couldn’t help telling her so.</p>

<p>One of the important housewifely cares of
Philadelphia women was their marketing,
and Madam Marshall was faithful in this
duty also. We find her attending market as
early as four o’clock upon a winter’s morning.
In 1690, there were two market days weekly
in Philadelphia, and nearly all the early writers
note the attendance thereat of the ladies
residing in the town. In 1744, these markets
were held on Tuesday and Friday. William
Black, a travelling Virginian, wrote that year
with admiration of this custom:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I got to the market by 7, and had no small
Satisfaction in seeing the pretty Creatures, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
Young Ladies, traversing the place from Stall to
Stall where they could make the best Market,
some with their maid behind them with a Basket
to carry home the Purchase, others that were
design’d to buy but trifles, as a little fresh Butter,
a Dish of Green Peas or the like, had Good
Nature &amp; Humility enough to be their own Porters.
I have so much regard for the fair Sex
that I imagin’d like the Woman of the Holy
Writ some charm in touching even the Hem of
their Garments. After I made my Market, which
was one pennyworth of Whey and a Nosegay, I
disengag’d myself.</p>
</div>

<p>It would appear also that a simple and
appropriate garment was donned for this
homely occupation. We find Sarah Eve and
others writing of wearing a “market cloke.”</p>

<p>It is with a keen thrill of sympathy that
we read of all the torment that Mistress
Marshall, that household saint, had to endure
in the domestic service rendered to her—or
perhaps I should say through the lack of
service in her home. A special thorn in the
flesh was one Poll, a bound girl. On September
13, 1775, Mr. Marshall wrote:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After my wife came from market (she went past
5) she ordered her girl Poll to carry the basket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
with some necessaries to the place, as she was
coming after her, they intending to iron the
clothes. Poll accordingly went, set down the
basket, came back, went and dressed herself all
clean, short calico gown, and said she was going
to school; but presently after the negro woman
Dinah came to look for her, her mistress having
mistrusted she had a mind to play truant. This
was about nine, but madam took her walk, but
where—she is not come back to tell.</p>

<p>Sept. 16. I arose before six as I was much
concern’d to see my wife so afflicted as before on
the bad conduct of her girl Poll who is not yet
returned, but is skulking and running about town.
This I understand was the practice of her mother
who for many years before her death was a constant
plague to my wife, and who left her this girl
as a legacy, and who by report as well as by own
knowledge, for almost three years has always
been so down to this time. About eight, word
was brought that Poll was just taken by Sister
Lynn near the market, and brought to their
house. A messenger was immediately dispatched
for her, as she could not be found before, though
a number of times they had been hunting her.</p>
</div>

<p>As the years went on, Poll kept taking
what he called “cruises,” “driving strokes
of impudence,” visiting friends, strolling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
around the streets, faring up and down the
country, and he patiently writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This night our girl was brought home. I suppose
she was hunted out, as it is called, and
found by Ruth on the Passyunk Road. Her
mistress was delighted upon her return, but I
know of nobody else in house or out. I have
nothing to say in the affair, as I know of nothing
that would distress my wife so much as for me to
refuse or forbid her being taken into the house.</p>

<p>(A short time after) I arose by four as my wife
had been up sometime at work cleaning house,
and as she could not rest on account of Polls
not being yet return’d. The girls frolics always
afflict her mistress, so that to me its plain if she
does not mend, or her mistress grieve less for
her, that it will shorten Mrs Marshalls days considerably;
besides our house wears quite a different
face when Miss Poll is in it (although all
the good she does is not worth half the salt she
eats.) As her presence gives pleasure to her
mistress, this gives joy to all the house, so that
in fact she is the cause of peace or uneasiness
in the home.</p>
</div>

<p>It is with a feeling of malicious satisfaction
that we read at last of the jaded, harassed,
and conscientious wife going away for a
visit, and know that the man of the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
will have to encounter and adjust domestic
problems as best he may. No sooner had
the mistress gone than Poll promptly departed
also on a vacation. As scores of
times before, Mr. Marshall searched for her,
and retrieved her (when she was ready to
come), and she behaved exceeding well for a
day, only, when rested, to again make a flitting.
He writes on the 23d:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I roused Charles up at daylight. Found Miss
Poll in the straw house. She came into the
kitchen and talked away that she could not go
out at night but she must be locked out. If that’s
the case she told them she would pack up her
clothes and go quite away; that she would not be
so served as her Mistress did not hinder her staying
out when she pleased, and the kitchen door
to be opened for her when she came home and
knocked. The negro woman told me as well as
she could what she said. I then went and picked
up her clothes that I could find. I asked her
how she could behave so to me when I had conducted
myself so easy towards her even so as to
suffer her to sit at table and eat with me. This
had no effect upon her. She rather inclined to
think that she had not offended and had done
nothing but what her mistress indulged her in.
I told her before Betty that it was not worth my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
while to lick her though she really deserved it for
her present impudence; but to remember I had
taken all her clothes I could find except what she
had on, which I intended to keep; that if she
went away Charles with the horse should follow
her and bring her back and that I would send
a bellman around the borough of Lancaster to
cry her as a runaway servant, wicked girl, with
a reward for apprehending her.</p>
</div>

<p>The fatuous simplicity of Quaker Marshall’s
reproofs, the futility of his threats, the
absurd failure of his masculine methods, received
immediate illustration—as might be
expected, by Miss Poll promptly running
away that very night. Again he writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Charles arose near daybreak and I soon after,
in order to try to find my nightly and daily
plague, as she took a walk again last night.
Charles found her. We turned her upstairs to
refresh herself with sleep....</p>

<p>(Two days later) After breakfast let our Poll
downstairs where she has been kept since her
last frolic. Fastened her up again at night. I
think my old enemy Satan is much concerned in
the conduct and behavior of that unfortunate
girl. He knows her actions give me much anxiety
and indeed at times raise my anger so I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
said what should have been avoided, but I hope
for the future to be more upon my guard and
thus frustrate him in his attempts.</p>
</div>

<p>With what joy did the masculine housekeeper
and steward greet the return of his
capable wife, and resign his position as turnkey!
Poll, upon liberation from restraint,
flew swiftly away like any other bird from
its cage.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Notwithstanding such heavy weather overhead
and exceeding dirty under foot our Poll after
breakfast went to see the soldiers that came as
prisoners belonging to Burgoynes army. Our
trull returned this morning. Her mistress gave
her a good sound whipping. This latter was a
variety.</p>
</div>

<p>And so the unequal fight went on; Poll
calmly breaking down a portion of the fence
that she might decamp more promptly, and
return unheralded. She does not seem to
have been vicious, but simply triumphantly
lawless and fond of gadding. I cannot
always blame her. I am sure I should have
wanted to go to see the soldier-prisoners of
Burgoyne’s army brought into town. The
last glimpse of her we have is with “her
head dressed in tiptop fashion,” rolling off in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
a coach to Yorktown with Sam Morris’s son,
and not even saying good-by to her vanquished
master.</p>

<p>Mr. Marshall was not the only Philadelphian
to be thus afflicted; we find one of his
neighbors, Jacob Hiltzheimer, dealing a more
summary way with a refractory maid-servant.
Shortly after noting in the pages of his diary
that “our maid Rosina was impertinent to
her mistress,” we find this good citizen taking
the saucy young redemptioner before the
squire, who summarily ordered her to the
workhouse. After remaining a month in
that confinement, Rosina boldly answered
no, when asked if she would go back to her
master and behave as she ought, and she
was promptly remanded. But she soon
repented, and was released. Her master
paid for her board and lodging while under
detention, and quickly sold her for £20 for
her remaining term of service.</p>

<p>With the flight of the Marshalls’ sorry
Poll, the sorrows and trials of this good
Quaker household with regard to what Raleigh
calls “domesticals” were not at an end.
As the “creatures” and the orchard and garden
needed such constant attention, a man-servant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
was engaged—one Antony—a
character worthy of Shakespeare’s comedies.
Soon we find the master writing:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I arose past seven and had our gentleman to
call down stairs. I spoke to him about his not
serving the cows. He at once began about his
way being all right, &amp;c. I set about serving
our family and let him, as in common, do as he
pleases. I think I have hired a plague to my
spirit. Yet he is still the same Antony—he
says—complaisant, careful, cheerful, industrious.</p>
</div>

<p>Then Antony grew noisy and talkative, so
abusive at last that he had to be put out
in the yard, where he railed and talked till
midnight, to the annoyance of the neighbors
and the mortification of his mistress;
for he protested incessantly and noisily that
all he wished was to leave in peace and
quiet, which he was not permitted to do.
Then, and repeatedly, his master told him
to leave, but the servant had no other home,
and might starve in the war-desolated town;
so after half-promises he was allowed by
these tender folk to stay on. Soon he
had another “tantrum,” and the astounded
Quaker writes:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He rages terribly uttering the most out of the
way wicked expressions yet not down-right swearing.
Mamma says it is cursing in the Popish
way....</p>
</div>

<p>What this Popish swearing could have
been arouses my curiosity; I suspect it was
a kind of “dog-latin.” Antony constantly
indulged in it, to the horror and sorrow of
the pious Marshalls. And the amusing, the
fairly comic side of all this is that Antony
was a preacher, a prophet in the land, and
constantly held forth in meeting to sinners
around him. We read of him:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Antony went to Quakers meeting today where
he preached; although he was requested to desist,
so that by consent they broke up the meeting
sooner than they would have done....</p>

<p>Mamma went to meeting where Antony spoke
and was forbid. He appeared to be most consummately
bold and ignorant in his speaking
there. And about the house I am obliged in a
stern manner at times to order him not to say
one word more....</p>

<p>This afternoon Antony preached at the English
Presbyterian meeting. It is said that the
hearers laughed at him but he was highly pleased
with himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>Antony preached at meeting. I kept engaged
helping to cook the pot against master came
home. He comes and goes as he pleases.</p>
</div>

<p>I don’t know when to pity poor Dame
Marshall the most, with Antony railing in
the yard and disturbing the peace of the
neighbors; or Antony cursing in a Popish
manner through the house; or Antony shamming
sick and moaning by the fireside; or
Antony violently preaching when she had
gone to the quiet Quaker meeting for an
hour of peace and rest.</p>

<p>This “runnagate rascal” was as elusive,
as tricky, as malicious as a gnome; whenever
he was reproved, he always contrived
to invent a new method of annoyance in
revenge. When chidden for not feeding the
horse, he at once stripped the leaves off the
growing cabbages, cut off the carrot heads,
and pulled up the potatoes, and pretended
and protested he did it all solely to benefit
them, and thus do good to his master.
When asked to milk the cow, he promptly
left the Marshall domicile for a whole day.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sent Antony in the orchard to watch the boys.
As I was doubtful sometime whether if any came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
for apples Antony would prevent, I took a walk
to the back fence, made a noise by pounding as
if I would break the fence, with other noise.
This convinced me Antony sat in his chair. He
took no notice till my wife and old Rachel came
to him, roused him, and scolded him for his
neglect. His answer was that he thought it his
duty to be still and not disturb them, as by so
doing he should have peace in heaven and a
blessing would ever attend him.</p>
</div>

<p>This was certainly the most sanctimonious
excuse for laziness that was ever invented;
and on the following day Antony supplemented
his tergiversation by giving away all
Mr. Marshall’s ripe apples through the fence
to passers-by—neighbors, boys, soldiers, and
prisoners. There may have been method in
this orchard madness, for Antony loathed
apple-pie, a frequent comestible in the Marshall
domicile, and often refused to drink
cider, and grumbling made toast-tea instead.
In a triumph of euphuistic indignation, Mr.
Marshall thus records the dietetic vagaries
of the “most lazy impertinent talking lying
fellow any family was ever troubled with:”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When we have no fresh broth he wants some;
when we have it he cant sup it. When we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
lean of bacon he wants the fat; when the fat he
cant eat it without spreading salt over it as without
it its too heavy for his stomach. If new
milk he cant eat it till its sour, it curdles on his
stomach; when sour or bonnyclabber it gives
him the stomach-ache. Give him tea he doesn’t
like such slop, its not fit for working men; if he
hasn’t it when he asks for it he’s not well used.
Give him apple pie above once for some days,
its not suitable for him it makes him sick. If
the negro woman makes his bed, she dont make
it right; if she dont make it she’s a lazy black
jade, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>In revenge upon the negro woman Dinah
for not making his bed to suit his notion, he
pretended to have had a dream about her,
which he interpreted to such telling effect
that she thought Satan was on his swift way
to secure her, and fled the house in superstitious
fright, in petticoat and shift, and
was captured three miles out of town. On
her return, Antony outdid himself with “all
the vile ribaldry, papist swearing, incoherent
scurrilous language, that imperious pride,
vanity, and folly could invent or express”—and
then went off to meeting to preach and
pray. Well might the Quaker say with Juvenal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
“The tongue is the worst part of a bad
servant.” At last, exasperated beyond measure,
his patient master vowed, “Antony, I
will give thee a good whipping,” and he could
do it, for he had “pacified himself with sundry
stripes of the cowskin” on Dinah, the negro,
when she, in emulation of Antony, was impertinent
to her mistress.</p>

<p>The threat of a whipping brought on Antony
a “fit of stillness” which descended
like a blessing on the exhausted house. But
“the devil is sooner raised than laid;” anon
Antony was in his old lunes again, and the
peace was broken by a fresh outburst of laziness,
indifference, and abuse, in which we
must leave this afflicted household, for at
that date the <i>Remembrancer</i> abruptly closes.</p>

<p>The only truly good service rendered to
those much tried souls was by a negro woman,
Dinah, who, too good for this earth,
died; and in her death involved them
in fresh trouble, for in that
war-swept town they could
scarce procure her
burial.</p>

<p>Around the great glowing fireplace in
an old New England kitchen centred
the homeliness and picturesqueness of an old-time
home. The walls and floor were bare;
the furniture was often meagre, plain, and
comfortless; the windows were small and ill-fitting;
the whole house was draughty and
cold; but in the kitchen glowed a beneficent
heart that spread warmth and cheer and
welcome, and beauty also when</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">the old rude-furnished room</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Burst flower-like into rosy bloom.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The settlers builded great chimneys with
ample open hearths, and to those hearths
the vast forests supplied plentiful fuel; but
as the forests disappeared in the vicinity of
the towns, the fireplaces also shrank in size,
so that in Franklin’s day he could write of
the big chimneys as “the fireplaces of our
fathers;” and his inventions for economizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
fuel had begun to be regarded as necessities.</p>

<p>The kitchen was the housewife’s domain,
the chimney-seat her throne; but the furniture
of that throne and the sceptre were
far different from the kitchen furnishings of
to-day.</p>

<p>We often see fireplaces with hanging
cranes in pictures illustrating earliest colonial
times, but the crane was unknown in
those days. When the seventeenth-century
chimney was built, ledges were left on either
side, and on them rested the ends of a long
heavy pole of green wood, called a lug-pole
or back bar. The derivation of the word
lug-pole is often given as meaning from lug
to lug, as the chimney-side was often called
the lug. Whittier wrote:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And for him who sat by the chimney lug.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Others give it from the old English word
<i>lug</i>, to carry; for it was indeed the carrying-pole.
It was placed high up in the yawning
chimney, with the thought and intent of its
being out of reach of the devouring flames,
and from it hung a motley collection of
hooks of various lengths and weights, sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
with long rods, sometimes with chains,
and rejoicing in various names. Pot-hooks,
pot-hangers, pot-hangles, pot-claws, pot-cleps,
were one and the same; so also were
trammels and crooks. Gib and gibcroke
were other titles. Hake was of course the
old English for hook:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">On went the boilers till the hake</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Had much ado to bear ’em.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A twi-crook was a double hook.</p>

<p>Other terms were gallow-balke, for the
lug-pole, and gallow-crookes for pot-hooks.
These were Yorkshire words, used alike in
that county by common folk and gentry.
They appear in the inventory of the goods
of Sir Timothy Hutton, and in the farming-book
of Henry Best, both dating to the time
of settlement of New England. A recon
was another Yorkshire name for a chain with
pot-hooks. They were heard but rarely in
New England.</p>

<p>The “eetch-hooke” named by Thomas
Angell, of Providence, in 1694, with his
“tramils and pot hookes” is an unknown
and undescribable form of trammel to me,
possibly an H-hook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>By these vari-named hooks were suspended
at various heights over the flames pots, kettles,
and other bailed cooking utensils.</p>

<p>The lug-pole, though made of green wood,
often became brittle or charred through too
long and careless use over the hot fire, and
was left in the chimney till it broke under
its weighty burden of food and metal. And
as within the chimney corner was a favorite
seat for both old and young of the household,
not only were precious cooking utensils
endangered and food lost, but human life as
well, as told in Judge Sewall’s diary, and in
other diaries and letters of the times. So,
when the iron crane was hung in the fireplace,
it not only added grace and convenience
to the family hearth, but safety as well.
On it still were hung the pot-hooks and
trammels, but with shortened arms or hangers.</p>

<p>The mantel was sometimes called by the
old English name, clavy or clavel-piece. In
one of John Wynter’s letters, written in
1634, he describes his new home in Maine:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The chimney is large, with an oven in each
end of him: he is so large that we can place our
Cyttle within the Clavell-piece. We can brew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
and bake and boyl our Cyttle all at once in
him.</p>
</div>

<p>The change in methods of cooking is
plainly evinced in many of our common
kitchen utensils. In olden times the pots
and kettles always stood on legs, and all
skillets and frying-pans and saucepans stood
on slender legs, that, if desired, they might
be placed with their contents over small
beds of coals raked to one side of the hearth.
A further convenience to assist this standing
over coals was a little trivet, a tripod or
three-footed stand, usually but a simple skeleton
frame on which the skillet could be
placed. In the corner of a fireplace would
be seen trivets with legs of various lengths,
through which the desired amount of heat
could be obtained. We read in Eden’s <i>First
Books on America</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He shulde fynde in one place a fryingpan, in
another chauldron, here a tryvet, there a spytte,
and these in kynde in every pore mans house:—</p>
</div>

<p>Of somewhat later date was the toast rack,
also standing on its little spindling legs.</p>

<p>No better list can be given of the kitchen
utensils of earliest colonial days in America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
than those found in the inventories of the
estates of the dead immigrants. These inventories
are, in some cases, still preserved
in the Colonial Court Records. We find
that Madam Olmstead, of Hartford, Conn.,
had, in 1640, in her kitchen:—</p>

<p>This was certainly a very good outfit. The
utensils for the manufacture and storage of
beer did not probably stand in the kitchen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
but in the lean-to or brew-house. A “cowl”
was a large tub with ears; in it liquids could
be carried by two persons, who bore the
ends of a pole thrust through the ears or
handles. Often with the cowl was specified
a pail with iron bail. William Harris, of
Pawtuxet, R. I., had, in 1681, “two Payles
and one jron Bayle” worth three shillings.
This naming of the pail-bail marked the
change in the form of pail handles; originally,
pails were carried by sticks thrust
through ears on either side of the vessel.</p>

<p>The jacks were waxed leather jugs or
drinking horns, much used in English alehouses
in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,
whose use gave rise to the singular
notion of the French that Englishmen drank
their ale out of their boots. Governor Winthrop
had jacks and leather bottles; but
both names disappear from inventories by
the year 1700, in New England.</p>

<p>These leather bottles were in universal
use in England “among shepherds and harvest-people
in the countrey.” They were
also called bombards. Their praises were
sung in a very spirited ballad, of which I
give a few lines:—</p>

<p>Latten-ware was a kind of brass. It may
be noted that no tin appears on this list, nor
in many of the inventories of these early
Connecticut colonists. Thomas Hooker had
several “tynnen covers.”</p>

<p>Brass utensils were far from cheap. Handsome
brass mortars were expensive. Brass
kettles were worth three pounds apiece. No
wonder the Indians wished their brass kettles
buried with them as their most precious
possessions. The brass utensils of William
Whiting, of Hartford, in 1649, were worth
twenty pounds; Thomas Hooker’s, about fifteen
pounds. Among other utensils named
in the inventories of some neighbors of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
Mr. Hooker were an “iron to make Wafer
cakes,” “dyitt vessels,” “shredin knife,”
“flesh fork.” Robert Day had a “brass
chaffin dish, 3s, lether bottle 2s, brass posnet
4s, brass pott 6s, brass kettle 2. 10s.” A
chafing-dish in olden times was an open box
of wire into which coals were thrust.</p>

<p>The “two Brandii” were brand-irons or
brond-yrons, a kind of trivet or support to
set on the andirons. Sometimes they held
brands or logs in place, or upon them dishes
could be placed. Toasting-irons and broiling-irons
are named. “Scieufes,” or sieves,
were worth a shilling apiece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>Eleazer Lusher, of Dedham, Mass., in
1672, owned cob-irons, trammels, firepans,
gridirons, toasting-fork, salt pan, brand pan,
mortar, pestle, box iron heaters, kettles, skillets,
spits, frying-pan, ladles, skimmers, chafing-dishes,
pots, pot-hooks, and creepers.</p>

<p>The name creeper brings to our consideration
one of the homeliest charms of the fireplace—the
andirons. Creepers were the
lower and smaller andirons placed between
the great firedogs. The word is also applied
to a low cooking spider, which could be
pushed in among the embers. Cob-irons
were the simplest form of andirons, and usually
were used merely to support the spit;
sometimes they had hooks to hold a dripping-pan
under the spit. Sometimes a fireplace
showed three pairs of andirons, on which
logs could be laid at various heights. Sometimes
a single pair of andirons had three
sets of hooks or branches for the same purpose.
They were made of iron, copper, steel,
or brass, often cast in a handsome design.
The andirons played an important part in
the construction and preservation of a fire.</p>

<p>And the construction of one of these great
fires was no light or careless matter. Whittier,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
in his <i>Snow-Bound</i>, thus tells of the
making of the fire in his home:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">We piled with care our nightly stack</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of wood against the chimney-back,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The oaken log, green, huge, and thick,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on its top the stout back-stick;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The knotty forestick laid apart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And filled between with curious art</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ragged brush; then hovering near</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We watched the first red blaze appear.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Often the great backlog had to be rolled
in with handspikes, sometimes drawn in by
a chain and yoke of oxen. The making of
the fire and its preservation from day to day
were of equal importance. The covering of
the brands at night was one of the domestic
duties, whose non-fulfillment in those matchless
days often rendered necessary a journey
with fire shovel to the house of the nearest
neighbor to obtain glowing coals to start
again the kitchen fire.</p>

<p>A domestic luxury seen in well-to-do homes
was a tin kitchen, a box-like arrangement
open on one side, which was set next the
blaze. It stood on four legs. In it bread
was baked or <i>roasted</i>. Through the kitchen
passed a spit, which could be turned by an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
external handle; on it meat was spitted to
be roasted.</p>

<p>The brick oven was not used so frequently,
usually but once a week. This was
a permanent furnishing. When the great
chimney was built, a solid heap of stones
was placed for its foundation, and a vast and
massive structure was reared upon it. On
one side of the kitchen fireplace, but really
a part of the chimney whole, was an oven
which opened at one side into the chimney,
and below an ash pit with swinging iron
doors with a damper. To heat this oven a
great fire of dry wood was kindled within it,
and kept burning fiercely for some hours.
Then the coal and ashes were removed, the
chimney draught and damper were closed,
and the food to be cooked was placed in the
heated oven. Great pans of brown bread,
pots of pork and beans, an Indian pudding,
a dozen pies, all went into the fiery furnace
together.</p>

<p>On Thanksgiving week the great oven was
heated night and morning for several days.
To place edibles at the rear of the glowing
oven, it is plain some kind of a shovel must
be used; and an abnormally long-handled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
one was universally found by the oven-side.
It was called a slice or peel, or fire-peel or
bread-peel. Such an emblem was it of domestic
utility and unity that a peel and a
strong pair of tongs were a universal and
luck-bearing gift to a bride. A good iron
peel and tongs cost about a dollar and a half.
The name occurs constantly in old wills
among kitchen properties. We read of “the
oven, the mawkin, the bavin, the peel.”
Sometimes, when the oven was heated, the
peel was besprinkled with meal, and great
heaps of rye and Indian dough were placed
thereon, and by a dextrous and indescribable
twist thrown upon cabbage leaves on the
oven-bottom, and thus baked in a haycock
shape.</p>

<p>“Shepherd Tom” Hazard, in his inimitable
<i>Jonny Cake Papers</i>, thus speaks of the
old-time methods of baking:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Rhineinjun bread, vulgarly called nowadays
rye and Indian bread, in the olden time was always
made of one quart of unbolted Rhode Island
rye meal to two quarts of the coarser grained
parts of Ambrosia (Narragansett corn meal) well
kneaded and made into large round loaves of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
size of a half-peck measure. There are two ways
of baking it. One way was to fill two large iron
basins with the kneaded dough and, late in the
evening, when the logs were well burned down,
to clear a place in the middle of the fire and
place the two basins of bread, one on top of the
other, so as to inclose their contents and press
them into one loaf. The whole was then carefully
covered with hot ashes, with coals on top,
and left until morning. Another way was to
place a number of loaves in iron basins in a
long-heated and well-tempered brick oven—stone
would not answer as the heat is too brittle—into
which a cup of water was also placed to make
the crust soft. The difference between brown
bread baked in this way, with its thick, soft,
sweet crust, from that baked in the oven of an
iron stove I leave to abler pens than mine to
portray.</p>
</div>

<p>In friendly chimney corners there stood a
jovial companion of the peel and tongs,
the flip iron, or loggerhead, or flip-dog, or
hottle. Lowell wrote:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Where dozed a fire of beechen logs that bred</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Strange fancies in its embers golden-red,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And nursed the loggerhead, whose hissing dip,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Timed by nice instinct, creamed the bowl of flip.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>
<p>Flip was a drink of vast popularity, and I
believe of potent benefit in those days when
fierce winters and cold houses made hot
drinks more necessary to the preservation of
health than nowadays. I have drunk flip,
but, like many a much-vaunted luxury of the
olden time, I prefer to read of it. It is indescribably
burnt and bitter in flavor.</p>

<p>It may be noted in nearly all old inventories
that a warming-pan is a part of the
kitchen furnishing. Wood wrote in 1634 of
exportation to the New England colony,
“Warming pannes &amp; stewing pannes are of
necessary use and very good traffick there.”
One was invoiced in 1642 at 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, another
in 1654 at 5<i>s.</i> A warming-pan was a shallow
pan of metal, usually brass or iron, about a
foot in diameter and three or four inches
deep, with a pierced brass or copper cover.
It was fitted with a long wooden handle.
When used, it was filled with coals, and when
thoroughly heated, was thrust between the
icy sheets of the bed, and moved up and
down to give warmth to every corner. Its
fireside neighbor was the footstove, a box of
perforated metal in a wooden frame, within
which hot coals could be placed to warm the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
feet of the goodwife during a long winter’s
drive, or to render endurable the arctic atmosphere
of the unheated churches. Often a
lantern of pierced metal hung near the warming-pan.
The old-time lanterns, still occasionally
found in New England kitchens or
barns, form a most interesting study for the
antiquary, and a much neglected fad for the
collector. I have one of Elizabethan shape,
to which, when I found it, fragments of thin
sheets of horn still clung—the remains of
the horn slides which originally were enclosed
in the metal frame.</p>

<p>High up on the heavy beam over the fireplace
stood usually a candlestick, an old lamp,
perhaps a sausage stuffer, or a spice-mill, or
a candle mold, a couple of wooden noggins,
sometimes a pipe-tongs. By the side of the
fireplace hung the soot-blackened, smoke-dried
almanac, and near it often hung a
betty-lamp, whose ill-smelling flame could
supply for conning the pages a closer though
scarce brighter light than the flickering
hearth flame.</p>

<p>By the hearth, sometimes in the chimney
corner, stood the high-backed settle, a sheltered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
seat, while the family dye-pot often was
used by the children as a chimney bench.</p>

<p>Many household utensils once in common
use in New England are now nearly obsolete.
In many cases the old-time names are disused
and forgotten, while the object itself may
still be found with some modern appellation.
In reading old wills, inventories, and enrollments,
and the advertisements in old newspapers,
I have made many notes of these
old names, and have sometimes succeeded,
though with difficulty, in identifying the
utensils thus designated. Of course the
different English shire dialects supply a variety
of local names. In some cases good
old English words have been retained in
constant use in New England, while wholly
archaic in the fatherland.</p>

<p>In every thrifty New England home there
stood a tub containing a pickle for salting
meat. It was called a powdering-tub, or
powdering-trough. This use of the word
“powder” for salt dates even before Shakespeare’s
day.</p>

<p>Grains is an obsolete word for tines or
prongs. Winthrop wrote in 1643 that a
snake crawled in the Assembly room, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
a parson “held it with his foot and staff with
a small pair of grains and killed it.”</p>

<p>Spenser used the word “flasket” thus:
“In which to gather flowers to fill their flasket.”
It was a basket, or hamper, made of
woven wicker. John Hull, writing in 1675,
asks that “Wikker Flasketts” be brought to
him on the <i>Sea Flower</i>.</p>

<p>A skeel was a small, shallow wooden tub,
principally used for holding milk to stand
for cream. It sometimes had one handle.
The word is now used in Yorkshire. Akin
to it is the word keeler, a small wooden tub,
which is still constantly heard in New England,
especially in application to a tub in
which dishes are washed. Originally, cedar
keelers were made to hold milk, and a losset
was also a large flat wooden dish used for
the same purpose. A skippet was a vessel
much like a dipper, small and round, with
long handle, and used for ladling liquids.</p>

<p>A quarn was a hand-mill for grinding meal,
and sometimes it stood in a room by itself.
It was a step in domestic progress beyond
pounding grain with a pestle in a mortar,
and was of earlier date than the windmill or
water-mill. In Wiclif’s translation we read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
in Matthew xxiv: “Two wymmen schalen be
gryndynge in quern,” etc. This word is also
used by Shakespeare in <i>Midsummer Night’s
Dream</i>. In early New England wills the
word is found, as in one of 1671: “1 paire
Quarnes and Lumber in the quarne house,
10s.” It was sometimes spelled “cairn,” as
in a Windham will, and also “quern” and
“quirn.”</p>

<p>Sometimes a most puzzling term will be
found in one of these old inventories, one
which appears absolutely incomprehensible.
Here is one which seems like a riddle of
which the answer is irrevocably lost: “One
Billy bassha Pan.” It is found in the kitchen
list of the rich possessions of Madam De
Peyster, in 1774, which inventory is preserved
in the family archives at the Van
Cortlandt Manor House, at Croton-on-Hudson.
You can give any answer you please
to the riddle; but my answer is this, in
slightly altered verse. I think that Madam
De Peyster’s cook used that dish to serve:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">A sort of soup or broth or stew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or hotchpot of all sorts of fishes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That Greenwich never could outdo,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Green herbs, red peppers, mussels, saffron,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
    <div class="verse indent2">Soles, onions, garlic, roach and dace;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All these were cooked in the Manor kitchen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In that one dish of Bouillabaisse.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The early settlers were largely indebted to
various forest trees for cheap, available, and
utilizable material for the manufacture of
both kitchen utensils and tableware. Wood-turning
was for many years a recognized
trade; dish-turner a business title. We find
Lion Gardiner writing to John Winthrop,
Jr., in 1652, “My wyfe desireth Mistress
Lake to get her a dozen of trays for shee
hearith that there is a good tray-maker with
you.”</p>

<p>Governor Bradford found the Indians using
wooden bowls, trays, and dishes, and the “Indian
bowls,” made from the knots of maple-trees,
were much sought after by housekeepers
till this century. A fine specimen of
these bowls is now in the Massachusetts
Historical Society. It was originally taken
from the wigwam of King Philip. Wooden
noggins (low bowls with handles) are constantly
named in early inventories, and Mary
Ring, of Plymouth, thought, in 1633, that a
“wodden cupp” was valuable enough to
leave by will as a token of friendship.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
Wooden trenchers, also made by hand, were
used on the table for more than a century,
and were universally bequeathed by will,
as by that of Miles Standish. White poplar
wood made specially handsome dishes.
Wooden pans were made in which to set
milk. Wooden bread troughs were used in
every home. These were oblong, trencher-shaped
bowls, about a foot and a half in
length, hollowed and shaped by hand from a
log of wood. Across the trough ran lengthwise
a stick or rod, on which the flour was
sifted in a temse, or searce, or sieve. The
saying, “set the Thames on fire,” is said to
have been originally “set the temse on
fire,” meaning that hard labor would, by the
friction of constant turning, set the wooden
temse, or sieve, on fire.</p>

<p>It was not necessary to apply to the wood-turner
to manufacture these simply shaped
dishes. Every winter the men and boys of
the household manufactured every kind of
domestic utensils and portions of farm implements
that could be whittled or made from
wood with simple tools. By the cheerful
kitchen fireside much of this work was done.
Indeed, the winter picture of the fireside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
should always show the figure of a whittling
boy. They made butter paddles of red
cherry, salt mortars, pig troughs, pokes, sled
neaps, ax helves, which were sawn, whittled,
and carefully scraped with glass; box traps
and “figure 4” traps, noggins, keelers, rundlets,
flails, cheese-hoops, cheese-ladders, stanchions,
handles for all kinds of farm implements,
and niddy-noddys. Strange to say,
the latter word is not found in any of our
dictionaries, though the word is as well
known in country vernacular as the article
itself—a hand-reel—or as the old riddle:—</p>

<p>There were still other wooden vessels. In
his <i>Philocothonista, or The Drunkard Opened,
Dissected and Anatomized</i> (1635), Thomas
Heywood, gives for “carouseing-bowles of
wood” these names: “mazers, noggins, whiskins,
piggins, cruizes, wassel-bowles, ale-bowles,
court-dishes, tankards, kannes.”</p>

<p>There were many ways of usefully employing
the winter evening hours. Some
thrifty folk a hundred years ago occupied
spare time in sticking card-teeth in wool-cards.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
The strips of pierced leather and the
wire teeth bent in proper shape were supplied
to them by the card manufacturer.
The long leather strips and boxes filled with
the bent wire teeth might be seen standing
in many a country home, and many an evening
by the light of the blazing fire,—for the
work required little eyesight or dexterity,—sat
the children on dye-pot, crickets, and
logs of wood, earning a scant sum to add to
their “broom-money.”</p>

<p>By the side of the chimney, in New England
country houses, always hung a broom
or besom of peeled birch. These birch
brooms were a characteristic New England
production. To make one a straight birch-tree
from three to four inches in diameter
was chosen, and about five feet of the trunk
was cut off. Ten inches from the larger end
a notch was cut around the stick, and the bark
peeled off from thence to the end. Then
with a sharp knife the bared end was carefully
split up to the notch in slender slivers,
which were held back by the broom-maker’s
left hand until they became too many and too
bulky to restrain, when they were tied back
with a string. As the tendency of the slivers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
or splints was to grow slightly thinner
toward the notch, there was left in the heart
of the growing broom a short core, which had
to be whittled off. When this was done the
splints were all turned back to their first
and natural position, a second notch was cut
an inch above the first one, leaving a strip
of bark an inch in diameter; the bark was
peeled off from what was destined to be
the broom handle, and a series of splints
was shaved down toward the second notch.
Enough of the stick was left to form the
handle; this was carefully whittled until an
inch or so in diameter, was smoothed, and
furnished with a hole in the end in which
to place a string or a strip of leather for suspension.
The second series of splints from
the handle end was firmly turned down and
tied with hempen twine over the wholly
splintered end, and all the splints cut off
the same length. The inch of bark which
remained of the original tree helped to hold
the broom-splints firmly in place.</p>

<p>When these brooms were partly worn, the
restraining string could be removed, and the
flaring splints formed an ideal oven-besom,
spreading and cleaning the ashes from every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
corner and crevice. Corn brooms were unknown
in these country neighborhoods until
about the middle of the present century.</p>

<p>A century, and even as late as half a century
ago, many a farmer’s son (and daughter
too) throughout New England earned his or
her first spending-money by making birch
brooms for the country stores, from whence
they were sent to the large cities, especially
Boston, where there was a constant demand
for them. In Northampton, about 1790, one
shopkeeper kept as many as seven or eight
hundred of these brooms on hand at one
time.</p>

<p>The boys and girls did not grow rich very
fast at broom-making. Throughout Vermont,
fifty years ago, the uniform price paid
to the maker for these brooms was but six
cents apiece, and as he had to work at least
three evenings to make one broom,—to say
nothing of the time spent in selecting and
cutting the birch-tree,—it was not so profitable
an industry as gathering beech-nuts
at a dollar a bushel. Major Robert Randolph
told in fashionable London circles, that
about the year 1750, he carried many a
load of these birch brooms on his back ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
miles to Concord, that he might thus earn a
few shillings. Such brooms were known by
different names in different localities: birch
brooms, splinter brooms, and Indian brooms.
The Indians were very proficient in making
them, and it is said invented them. This
can readily be believed, for like birch-bark
canoes and snowshoes, they are examples of
perfection in utility and in the employment
of native materials. Squaws wandered over
certain portions of the country bearing
brooms on their backs, peddling them from
house to house for ninepence apiece and a
drink of cider. In 1806, one minister of
Haverhill, New Hampshire, had two of these
brooms given to him as a marriage fee.
When a Hadley man planted broom corn in
1797, and made corn brooms to sell, he was
scornfully met with the remark that broom-making
was work for Indians and boys. It
was long ere his industry crowded out the
sturdy birch brooms.</p>

<p>There were many domestic duties which
did not waft sweet “odors of Araby;” the
annual spring manufacture of soft soap for
home consumption was one of them, and
also one of the most important and most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
trying of all the household industries. The
refuse grease from the family cooking was
stowed away in tubs and barrels through the
cool winter months in unsavory masses, and
the wood-ashes from the great fireplaces
were also thriftily stored until the carefully
chosen time arrived. The day was selected
with much deliberation, after close consultation
with that family counselor, the
almanac, for the moon must be in the right
quarter, and the tide at the flood, if the soap
were to “come right.” Then the leach
was set outside the kitchen door. Some
families owned a strongly made leach-tub,
some used a barrel, others cut a section from
a great birch-tree, and removed the bark to
form a tub, which was placed loosely in a
circular groove in a base made of wood or,
preferably, of stone. This was not set horizontally,
but was slightly inclined. The tub
was filled with ashes, and water was scantily
poured in until the lye trickled or leached
out of an outlet cut in the groove at the
base. The “first run” of lye was not strong
enough to be of use, and was poured again
upon the ashes. The wasted ashes were replenished
again and again, and water poured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
in small quantities on them, and the lye
accumulated in a receptacle placed for it. It
was a universal test that when the lye was
strong enough to hold up an egg, it was also
strong enough to use for the soap boiling.
In the largest iron pot the grease and lye
were boiled together, often over a great fire
built in the open air. The leached ashes
were not deemed refuse and waste; they
were used by the farmer as a fertilizer.
Soap made in this way, while rank and
strong, is so pure and clean that it seems
almost like a jelly, and shows no trace of
the vile grease that helped to form it.</p>

<p>The dancing firelight shone out on no
busier scene than on the grand candle-dipping.
It had taken weeks to prepare for this
domestic industry, which was the great
household event of the late autumn, as soap-making
was of the spring. Tallow had been
carefully saved from the domestic animals
killed on the farm, the honeyed store of
the patient bee had been robbed of wax to
furnish materials, and there was still another
source of supply.</p>

<p>The summer air of the coast of New England
still is sweet with one of the freshest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
purest plant-perfumes in the world—the
scent of bayberry. These dense woody
shrubs bear profusely a tiny, spicy, wax-coated
berry; and the earliest colonists
quickly learned that from this plentiful berry
could be obtained an inflammable wax, which
would replace and supplement any lack of
tallow. The name so universally applied to
the plant—candleberry—commemorates its
employment for this purpose. I never pass
the clumps of bayberry bushes in the early
autumn without eagerly picking and crushing
the perfumed leaves and berries; and
the clean, fresh scent seems to awaken a
dim recollection,—a hereditary memory,—and
I see, as in a vision, the sober little children
of the Puritans standing in the clear
glowing sunlight, and faithfully stripping
from the gnarled bushes the waxy candleberries;
not only affording through this occupation
material assistance to the household
supplies, but finding therein health, and I
am sure happiness, if they loved the bayberries
as I, their descendant, do.</p>

<p>The method of preparing this wax was
simple; it still exists in a few Plymouth
County households. The berries are simply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
boiled with hot water in a kettle, and the
resolved wax skimmed off the top, refined,
and permitted to harden into cakes or candles.
The references in old-time records
to this bayberry wax are too numerous to be
recounted. A Virginian governor, Robert
Beverley (for the bayberry and its wax was
known also in the South as myrtleberry
wax), gave, perhaps, the clearest description
of it:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A pale green brittle wax of a curious green
color, which by refining becomes almost transparent.
Of this they made candles which are
never greasy to the touch nor melt with lying in
the hottest weather; neither does the snuff of
these ever offend the smell, like that of a tallow
candle; but instead of being disagreeable, if an
accident puts a candle out, it yields a pleasant
fragrancy to all that are in the room; insomuch
that nice people often put them out on purpose
to have the incense of the expiring snuff.</p>
</div>

<p>It is true that the balmy breath of the
bayberry is exhaled even on its funeral pyre.
A bayberry candle burns like incense; and
I always think of its perfume as truly the
incense to the household hearth-gods of an
old New England home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>Bayberry wax was a standard farm-product,
a staple article of traffic, till this century, and
it was constantly advertised in the newspapers.
As early as 1712, Thomas Lechmere
wrote to John Winthrop, Jr.:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am now to beg one favour of you, that you
secure for me all the bayberry wax you can possibly
lay yor hands on. What charge you shall
be at securing it shall be thankfully paid you.
You must take a care that they do not putt too
much tallow among it, being a custome and
cheate they have gott.</p>
</div>

<p>When the candle-dipping began, a fierce
fire was built in the fireplace, and over it was
hung the largest house kettle, half filled with
water and melted tallow, or wax. Candle-rods
were brought down from the attic, or
pulled out from under the edge of beams,
and placed about a foot and a half apart,
reaching from chair to chair.</p>

<p>Boards were placed underneath to save
the spotless floor from greasy drippings.
Across these rods were laid, like the rounds
of a ladder, shorter sticks or reeds to which
the wicks were attached at intervals of a few
inches. The wicks of loosely spun cotton or
tow were dipped time and time again into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
melted tallow, and left to harden between
each dipping. Of course, if the end of the
kitchen (where stood the rods and hung the
wicks) were very cold, the candles grew
quickly, since they hardened quickly; but
they were then more apt to crack. When
they were of proper size, they were cut off,
spread in a sunny place in the garret to
bleach, and finally stored away in candle-boxes.
Sometimes the tallow was poured
into molds; when, of course, comparatively
few candles could be made in a day. In some
communities itinerant candle-makers carried
molds from house to house, and assisted in
the candle manufacture.</p>

<p>These candles were placed in candlesticks,
or in large rooms were set in rude
chandeliers of strips of metal with sockets,
called candle-beams. Handsome rooms had
sconces, and the kitchen often had a sliding
stand by which the candle could be adjusted
at a desired height. Snuffers were as indispensable
as candlesticks, and were sometimes
called snuffing-iron, or snit—a word
not in the <i>Century Dictionary</i>—from the old
English verb, “snyten,” to blow out. The
snuffers lay in a little tray called a snuffer-tray,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
snuffer-dish, snuffer-boat, snuffer-slice,
or snuffer-pan. Save-alls, a little wire frame
to hold up the last burning end of candle,
were another contrivance of our frugal ancestors.</p>

<p>In no way was a thrifty housewife better
known than through her abundant stock of
symmetrical candles; and nowhere was a
skilful and dextrous hand more needed than
in shaping them. Still, candles were not
very costly if the careless housewife chose
to purchase them. The <i>Boston Evening
Post</i> of October 5, 1767, has this advertisement:
“Dip’d Tallow Candles Half a Pistareen
the single Pound &amp; Cheaper by Cwt.”</p>

<p>In many a country household some old-time
frugalities linger, but the bounteous
oil-wells of Pennsylvania have rendered candles
not only obsolete, but too costly for
country use, and by a turn of fashion they
have become comparatively an article of
luxury, but still seem to throw an old-time
refinement wherever their soft rays shine.</p>

<p>An account of housewifely duties in my
great-grandmother’s home was thus written,
in halting rhyme, by one of her sons when
he too was old:—</p>

<p>The manufacture of the farm-reared wool
was not so burdensome and tedious a process
as that of flax, but it was far from
pleasant. The fleeces of wool had to be
opened out and cleaned of all sticks, burrs,
leaves, feltings, tar-marks, and the dirt which
always remained after months’ wear by the
sheep; then it had to be sorted out for
dyeing, which latter was a most unpleasant
process. Layers of the various colors of
wools after being dyed were rolled together
and carded on coarse wool-cards, again and
again, then slightly greased by a disagreeable
and tiresome method, then run into
rolls. The wool was spun on the great wheel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
which stood in the kitchen with the reel and
swifts, and often by the glowing firelight
the mother spun. A tender and beautiful
picture of this domestic scene has been
drawn by Dr. Gurdon Russell, of Hartford,
in his <i>Up Neck in 1825</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My mother was spinning with the great wheel,
the white rolls of wool lay upon the platform,
and as they were spun upon the spindle, she
turning the wheel with one hand, and with extended
arm and delicate fingers holding the roll
in the other, stepping backwards and forwards
lightly till it was spun into yarn, it formed a
picture to me, sitting upon a low stool, which
can never be forgotten. Her movements were
every grace, her form all of beauty to me who
opposite sat and was watching her dextrous
fingers.</p>
</div>

<p>The manufacture of flax into linen material
was ever felt to be of vast importance,
and was encouraged by legislation from earliest
colonial days, but it received a fresh
impulse in New England through the immigration
of about one hundred Irish families
from Londonderry. They settled in
New Hampshire on the Merrimac about
1719. They spun and wove by hand, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
with far more skill than prevailed among
those English settlers who had already become
Americans. They established a manufactory
according to Irish methods, and attempts
at a similar establishment were made
in Boston. There was much public excitement
over spinning. Women, rich as well
as poor, appeared on Boston Common with
their wheels, thus making spinning a popular
holiday recreation. A brick building
was erected as a spinning-school, and a
tax was placed in 1737 to support it. But
this was not an industrial success, the excitement
died out, the public spinning-school
lost its ephemeral popularity, and the wheel
became again simply a domestic duty and
pride.</p>

<p>For many years after this, housewives had
everywhere flax and hemp to spin and weave
in their homes, and the preparation of these
staples seems to us to-day a monumental
labor. On almost every farm might be seen
a patch of the pretty flax, ripening for the
hard work of pulling, rippling, rotting, breaking,
swingling, and combing, which all had to
be done before it came to the women’s hands
for spinning. The seed was sown broad-cast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
and allowed to grow till the bobs or
bolls were ripe. The flax was then pulled
and spread neatly in rows to dry. This
work could be done by boys. Then men
whipped or threshed or rippled out all the
seed to use for meal; afterwards the flax
stalks were allowed to lie for some time in
water until the shives were thoroughly rotten,
when they were cleaned and once more
thoroughly dried and tied in bundles. Then
came work for strong men, to break the flax
on the ponderous flaxbreak, to get out the
hard “hexe” or “bun,” and to swingle it
with a swingle knife, which was somewhat
like a wooden dagger. Active men could
swingle forty pounds a day on the swingling-board.
It was then hetchelled or combed
or hackled by the housewife, and thus the
rough tow was gotten out, when it was
straightened and made ready for the spruce
distaff, round which it was finally wrapped.
The hatchelling was tedious work and irritating
to the lungs, for the air was filled
with the fluffy particles which penetrated
everywhere. The thread was then spun on
a “little wheel.” It was thought that to
spin two double skeins of linen, or four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
double skeins of tow, or to weave six yards
of linen, was a good day’s work. For a
week’s work a girl received fifty cents and
“her keep.” She thus got less than a cent
and a half a yard for weaving. The skeins
of linen thread went through many tedious
processes of washing and bleaching before
being ready for weaving; and after the cloth
was woven it was “bucked” in a strong
lye, time and time again, and washed out
an equal number of times. Then it was
“belted” with a maple beetle on a smooth,
flat stone; then washed and spread out to
bleach in the pure sunlight. Sometimes the
thread, after being spun and woven, had been
washed and belted a score of times ere it
was deemed white and soft enough to use.
The little girls could spin the “swingling
tow” into coarse twine, and the older ones
make “all tow” and “tow and linen” and
“harden” stuffs to sell.</p>

<p>To show the various duties attending the
manufacture of these domestic textiles by a
Boston woman of intelligence and social
standing, as late as 1788, let me quote a few
entries from the diary of the wife of Col.
John May:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A large kettle of yarn to attend upon. Lucretia
and self rinse our through many waters, get
out, dry, attend to, bring in, do up and sort 110
score of yarn, this with baking and ironing.</p>

<p>Went to hackling flax.</p>

<p>Rose early to help Ruth warp and put a piece
in the loom.</p>

<p>Baking and hackling yarn. A long web of
tow to whiten and weave.</p>
</div>

<p>The wringing out of this linen yarn was
most exhausting, and the rinsing in various
waters was no simple matter in those days,
for the water did not conveniently run into
the houses through pipes and conduits, but
had to be laboriously carried in pailfuls from
a pump, or more frequently raised in a
bucket from a well.</p>

<p>I am always touched, when handling the
homespun linens of olden times, with a sense
that the vitality and strength of those enduring
women, through the many tedious and
exhausting processes which they had bestowed,
were woven into the warp and woof
with the flax, and gave to the old webs of
linen their permanence and their beautiful
texture. How firm they are, and how lustrous!
And how exquisitely quaint and fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
are their designs; sometimes even Scriptural
designs and lessons are woven into them.
They are, indeed, a beautiful expression of
old-time home and farm life. With their
close-woven, honest threads runs this finer
beauty, which may be impalpable and imperceptible
to a stranger, but which to me is
real and ever-present, and puts me truly in
touch with the life of my forbears. But,
alas, it is through intuition we must learn of
this old-time home life, for it has vanished
from our sight, and much that is beautiful
and good has vanished with it.</p>

<p>The associations of the kitchen fireside
that linger in the hearts of those who are
now old can find no counterpart in our
domestic surroundings to-day. The welcome
cheer of the open fire, which graced and
beautified even the humblest room, is lost
forever with the close gatherings of the
family, the household occupations, the homespun
industries which formed and imprinted
in the mind of every
child the picture of
a home.</p>
